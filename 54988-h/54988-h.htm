      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he meeting of the
      man and the woman&mdash;it is to this that every story in the world goes
      back for its beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon on a day late in September the express train from Paris rested,
      panting and impatient, on its brief halt in the station at Rouen. The
      platform was covered with groups of passengers, pushing their way into or
      out of the throng about the victualer&rsquo;s table. Through the press passed
      waiters, bearing above their heads trays with cups of tea and plates of
      food. People were climbing the high steps to the carriages, or beckoning
      to others from the open windows of compartments. Four minutes of the
      allotted five had passed. The warning cries of the guards had begun, and
      there was even to be heard the ominous preliminary tooting of a horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the front of the section of first-class carriages a young woman leaned
      through the broad window-frame of a coupé, and held a difficult
      conversation with one of the waiters. She had sandwiches in one hand, some
      loose coin in the other. Her task was to get at the meaning of a man who
      spoke of sous while she was thinking in centimes, and she smiled a little
      in amused vexation with herself at the embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deux sandwich: combien si vous plait, monsieur?&rdquo; she repeated, with an
      appealing stress of courtesy. More slowly she constructed a second
      sentence: &ldquo;Est un franc assez?&rdquo; She proffered the silver coin to help out
      her inquiry, and the waiter, nodding, put up his hand for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the instant, as the noise of slamming doors and the chorus of &ldquo;Au
      coupé, s&rsquo;il-v&rsquo;-plait!&rdquo; grew peremptory, one in authority pushed the waiter
      aside and pulled open the coupé door upon which she had been leaning.
      &ldquo;Permettez moi, madame!&rdquo; he said curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close at his back was a young man, with wraps upon his arm and a traveling
      bag in his hand, who was flushed and breathing hard with the excitement of
      hurry, and who drew a long sigh of relief as he put his foot on the bottom
      step of the coupé.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman had grasped the door and was striving stoutly to drag it
      to her. &ldquo;Mais non, monsieur!&rdquo; she shouted, her voice quivering with
      vehemence. &ldquo;Cette compartement est tout reserveé-engageé! J&rsquo;ai donné sank
      franc soisante, en Paris, pour moi seulement! Je proteste!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sharp blasts from a horn at the rear of the train broke in upon her
      earnest if uncertain remarks. The official held up one warning hand, while
      with the other he wrenched the door wide open. He said something of which
      the girl comprehended only its arbitrary harshness of spirit. Brusquely
      thrusting a ticket into the young man&rsquo;s hand, he pushed him up the steps
      into the compartment, and closed the door upon him with a clang. Arms were
      waving outside; the tin horn screamed; a throb of reawakened energy
      thrilled backward through the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you&mdash;I am so sorry,&rdquo; the young man began, still standing by
      the door. His voice was gentle and deprecatory. His words were English,
      but the tone was of some other language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have taken the whole compartment-I paid for it all!&rdquo; she burst out
      at him, her voice shaking with indignation. &ldquo;It is an outrage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you are mistaken,&rdquo; he started to speak again; &ldquo;you obtained
      only one seat&mdash;I have a ticket for another. If there had been time, I
      beg you to believe&mdash;&rdquo; The train was moving, and a swift plunge into
      utter darkness abruptly broke off his speech. After a few moments it
      became possible to discern vague outlines in the black compartment. The
      girl had huddled herself on the end cushion at the right. The young man
      took his seat in the corner to the left, and for three incredibly
      protracted minutes the tunnel reared its uncanny barrier of bogus night
      between them. The dim suggestion of light which remained to them revealed
      constrained and motionless figures drawn rigidly away from each other, and
      pale averted countenances staring fixedly into the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once they were blinking in a flood of sunshine, and drawing welcome
      breaths of the new, sweet air which swept through from window to window.
      The young man&rsquo;s gaze, decorously turned to his left, was of a sudden
      struck with the panorama as by a blow. He uttered a little cry of delight
      to himself, and bent forward with eagerness to grasp as much as he might
      of what was offered. The broad, hill-rimmed basin of the Seine; the gray
      towers and shining spires of the ancient town; the blue films of smoke
      drifting through the autumn haze; the tall black chimneys, the narrow,
      high poplars, the splashes of vivid color with which the mighty moving
      picture painted itself&mdash;all held him, rapt and trembling, with his
      face out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summarily the darkness descended upon them again. He drew back, settled
      himself in his seat and recalled the circumstance that he was not alone.
      It occurred to him to pull up the window, and then instinctively he turned
      to see if she had taken the same precaution on her side. Thus when the
      short second tunnel unexpectedly ended, he found himself regarding his
      companion with wideeyed and surprised intentness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two vacant seats between them, and across this space she
      returned his scrutiny for a moment; then with a fine show of calm she
      looked away, out through the broad, rounded panes which constituted the
      front of the compartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the eye of the young man, she was above all things English. Her
      garments, her figure, the pose of her head, the consciously competent
      repose of her profile, the very angle at which the correct gray hat, with
      its fawn-colored ribbon, crossed the line of the brow above&mdash;these
      spoke loudly to him of the islander. From this fact alone would be
      inferred a towering personal pride, and an implacable resentment toward
      those who, no matter how innocently and accidentally, offered injury to
      that pride. He knew the English well, and it hardly needed this partial
      view of her face to tell him that she was very angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another young man, under these conditions, might have more frankly asked
      himself whether the face was a beautiful one. He was conscious that the
      query had taken shape in his mind, but he gave it no attention. It was the
      character of the face, instead, which had powerfully impressed him. He
      recalled with curious minuteness the details of his first glimpse of it&mdash;the
      commanding light in the gray eyes, the tightened curves of the lip, the
      mantling red on the high, smooth cheek. Was it a pretty face? No&mdash;the
      question would not propound itself. Prettiness had nothing to do with the
      matter. The personality which looked through the face&mdash;that was what
      affected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The compartment seemed filled in some subtle way with the effect of this
      personality. He looked out of his window again. A beautiful deep valley
      lay below him now, with densely wooded hills beyond. The delicate tints of
      the waning season enriched the tracery of foliage close at hand; still the
      tall chimneys, mixed with poplars, marked the course of the enslaved
      river, but the factories themselves were kindly hidden here by dark
      growths of thicket in the shadowed depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was surpassingly beautiful, but its contemplation left him restless. He
      moved about on his seat, partially lowered the window, put it up again and
      at last turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid that all the charming landscape is on this side,&rdquo; he made
      bold to say. &ldquo;I will change places with pleasure, if&mdash;if you would be
      so kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; was her spontaneous and decisive reply. Upon reflection
      she added in a more deliberate tone: &ldquo;I should be obliged if you would
      take the view that conversation is not necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some latent strain of temerity amazed the young man by rising to the
      surface of his mind, under the provocation of this rebuff, and shaping his
      purpose for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only fair to myself, first, however,&rdquo; he with surprise heard
      himself declaring, &ldquo;that I should finish my explanation. You can satisfy
      yourself readily at Dieppe that your ticket is for only one seat. It is
      very, easy to make errors of that kind when one does not&mdash;that is to
      say, is not&mdash;well, <i>entirely</i> familiar with the language of the
      country. As to my own part, you will remember that I came only at the last
      moment. I took my coupé seat a half hour before, because I also wished to
      be alone, and then I went out to see Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc&rsquo;s tower again, and I was
      nearly too late. If there had been time, I would have found a seat
      elsewhere&mdash;but you yourself saw&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I think no more need be said,&rdquo; broke in his companion. She looked
      him frankly, coldly in the face as she spoke, and her words seemed in his
      ears to have metallic edges. &ldquo;It is plain enough that there was a mistake.
      As you have suggested, my French is very faulty indeed, and no doubt the
      misunderstanding is entirely my own. So, since it is unavoidable, there
      surely need be no more words about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened a book at this, put her feet out to the stool in front and
      ostentatiously disposed herself for deep abstraction in literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man in turn got out some pamphlets and papers from the pockets
      of his great-coat, and pretended to divide his attention between these and
      the scenery outside. In truth, he did not for a moment get the face of
      this girl out of his thoughts. More than ever now, since she had looked
      him fully in the eye, it was not a face to be pictured in the brain as
      other faces of women had been. The luminous substance of the individuality
      behind the face shone out at him from the pages he stared at, and from the
      passing vistas of lowland meadows, streams and mill-towns that met his
      gaze through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew so little of women that his mind was quite devoid of materials for
      any comparative analysis of the effect she produced upon him. He evolved
      for himself, indeed, the conviction that really this was the first woman,
      in the genuine and higher meaning of the word, that he had ever met. The
      recognition of this brought with it an excitement as novel to him as the
      fact itself. Before ever he had seen her, clinging to the coupé door with
      her gloved hands and so bravely doing hopeless and tongue-tied battle with
      the guard, there had been things which had made this the greatest day of
      his life. He was in truth finishing the last stage of a journey into the
      unknown, the strange possibilities of which had for a week kept his nerves
      on the rack. The curtain of only one more night hung now between him and
      the revealed lineaments of destiny. To be alone with his perturbed
      thoughts, on this culminating day of anxious hopes and dreads, had been
      his controlling idea at Rouen. It was for this that he had bought the
      coupé seat, upon the rumor of the station that solitude was thus to be
      commanded. And now how extraordinary was the chance!
    </p>
    <p>
      There had stepped into this eventful day, as from the clouds, a stranger
      whose mysterious appeal to his imagination seemed more remarkable than all
      else combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      He worked this out, painstakingly, with little sidelong glances from time
      to time toward where she sat buried in her book, to check the progression
      of his reasoning. When he reached the conclusion that she was really
      playing this predominant part in the drama of the day, its suggestion of
      hysterical folly rather frightened him. He looked with earnestness out of
      the window, and even be gan to count the chimneys of the landscape as an
      overture to returning sanity. Then he looked less furtively at her and
      said to himself with labored plausibility that she was but an ordinary
      traveling Englishwoman, scarcely to be differentiated from the
      Cook&rsquo;s-tourist type that he knew so well; she had not even a governess&rsquo;
      knowledge of French, and there had been nothing in her words and tone with
      him to indicate either mental distinction or kindliness of temper. Why
      should he bestow so much as another thought upon her? He squared his
      slender shoulders, and turned with resolution to his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later the impossibility of the situation had mastered every fiber
      of his brain. He put down the volume, feeling himself to be a fool for
      doing so, yet suffering himself with an unheard-of gladness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I anger you, I shall be much pained,&rdquo; he said, with a set face turned
      not quite toward her, and a voice that he kept from breaking by constant
      effort, &ldquo;but I am going to England for the first time, and there are some
      things that I am very anxious to ask about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to reflect a little before she lifted her head. Now again he
      was priviledged to look squarely into her face, and he added swiftly to
      his store a new impression of her. The ruling characteristic of the
      countenance was a certain calm and serious reasonableness. The forehead
      was broad and comely; the glance of the eyes was at once alert and steady.
      The other features were content to support this controlling upper part of
      the face; they made a graceful and fitting frame for the mind which
      revealed itself in the eyes and brow&mdash;and sought to do no more.
      Studying her afresh in this moment of her silence, he recalled the face of
      a young Piedmontese bishop who had come once to his school. It had the
      same episcopal serenity, the same wistful pride in youth&rsquo;s conquest of the
      things immortal, the same suggestion of intellectuality in its clear
      pallor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should dislike to seem rude,&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;What is it that you
      want to ask?&rdquo; What was it indeed? He searched confusedly about in his mind
      for some one question entitled to precedence among the thousand to which
      answers would come in good time. He found nothing better than a query as
      to the connection between New Haven and Brighton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this little book,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;there is a time for New Haven and
      for London, but I cannot find a mention of Brighton, yet I am expected
      there this evening, or perhaps, early to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I cannot tell you,&rsquo;&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;However, the places are not
      far apart. I should say there would certainly be trains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted the book again as she spoke, and adjusted her shoulders to the
      cushions. He made haste to prevent the interview from lapsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen England,&rdquo; he urged dolefully, &ldquo;and yet I am all English
      in my blood&mdash;and in my feelings, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flicker of ironical perception played for an instant in her eye and at
      the corner of her lip. &ldquo;I have heard that a certain class of Americans
      adopt that pose,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I dare say it is all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not grasp her meaning all at once, though the willingness to give
      umbrage conveyed in her tone was clear enough. He looked doubtfully at
      her, before he spoke again. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he began, with hesitation&mdash;&ldquo;yes, I
      see&mdash;you thought I was American. I am not in the least&mdash;I am all
      English. And it affects me very much&mdash;this thought that in a few
      hours now I am to see the real England. I am so excited about it, in
      fact,&rdquo; he added with a deprecatory little laugh, &ldquo;that I couldn&rsquo;t bear it
      not to talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded comprehendingly. &ldquo;I thought that your accent must be American&mdash;since
      it certainly isn&rsquo;t English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have too facile an ear,&rdquo; he answered readily, as if the subject
      were by no means new to him. &ldquo;I pick up every accent that I hear. I have
      been much with English people, but even more with Americans and
      Australians. I always talk like the last family I have been in&mdash;until
      I enter another. I am by profession a private tutor&mdash;principally in
      languages&mdash;and so I know my failings in this matter very well.&rdquo; She
      smiled at some passing retrospect. &ldquo;You must have had an especially
      complete sense of my shortcomings as a linguist, too. I have often
      wondered what effect my French would produce upon an actual professor, but
      I should never have had the courage to experiment, if I had known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand&mdash;a pale hand with veined, thin, nervous fingers,
      which she looked at in its foreign gesture. &ldquo;Too much importance is
      attached to languages,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;It is the cheapest and most trivial
      of acquirements, if it stands alone, or if it is not put to high uses.
      Parents have so often angered me over this: they do not care what is in
      their children&rsquo;s minds and hearts, but only for the polish and form of
      what is on their tongues. I have a different feeling about education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded again, and laid the book aside. &ldquo;You are coming to a country
      where everything will shock you, then,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I would rather do
      scullery work, or break stones by the roadside, than be a schoolteacher in
      England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s the same everywhere,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;I would not think that the
      English were worse than the others. They are different, that is all.
      Besides, I do not think I shall be a teacher in England. Of course, I
      speak in the dark; for a few hours yet everything is uncertain. But as the
      old American senator at Monte Carlo used to say, &lsquo;I feel it in my bones&rsquo;
      that I will not have to teach any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression of her face seemed somehow not to invite autobiography at
      the moment. &ldquo;The prospect of not having to work any more for one&rsquo;s
      living,&rdquo; she mused at him&mdash;&ldquo;how curiously fascinating it always is!
      We know perfectly well that it is good for us to work, and that we should
      be woefully unhappy if we did not work, and yet we are forever charming
      our imagination with a vision of complete idleness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not be idle!&rdquo; the young man broke forth, enthusiastically. He
      leaned forward in his seat, and spoke with eager hands as well as words
      against the noise that filled the swaying carriage. &ldquo;I have that same
      feeling&mdash;the longing to escape from the dull and foolish tasks I have
      to do&mdash;but I never say to myself that I would be idle. There are such
      a host of things to do in the world that are worth doing! But the men who
      have the time and the money, who are in the position to do these things&mdash;how
      is it, I ask myself, that they never think of doing them? It is the
      greatest of marvels to me. Then sometimes I wonder, if the chance and the
      power came to me, whether I also would sit down, and fold my hands, and do
      nothing. It is hard to say; who can be sure what is in him till he has
      been tested? Yet I like to think that I would prove the exception. It is
      only natural,&rdquo; he concluded, smilingly, &ldquo;that one should try to think as
      well as possible of oneself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady surveyed his nervous, mobile face with thoughtful
      impassivity. &ldquo;You seem to think, one way or another, a good deal about
      yourself,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to her, with a certain exaggeration in his show of quite sincere
      humility which, she said to herself, had not been learned from his
      English-speaking connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say is very true,&rdquo; he admitted with candor. &ldquo;It is my fault&mdash;my
      failing. I know it only too well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>My</i> fault is bad manners,&rdquo; she replied, disarmed by his
      self-abasement. &ldquo;I had no business to say it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;It is delightful to me that you did say it. I could
      not begin to tell you how good your words sounded in my ears. Honest and
      wise criticism is what I have not heard before in years. You do not get it
      in the South; there is flattery for you, and sneering, and praise as much
      too high as blame is too cruel&mdash;but no candid, quiet judgments. Oh, I
      loved to hear you say that! It was like my brother&mdash;my older brother
      Salvator. He is in America now. He is the only one who always said the
      truth to me. And I am glad, too, because&mdash;because it makes you seem
      like a friend to me, and I have been so agitated this whole week, so
      anxious and upset, and all without a soul to talk to, or advise with&mdash;and
      the pressure on me has been so great&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He let the wandering sentence lose itself in the clamor of the train, and
      put the rest of his meaning into the glance with which he clung to hers.
      The appeal for sympathetic kindliness of treatment glowed in his eyes and
      shone upon his eager face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took time for her answer, and when she spoke it was hardly in direct
      reply. &ldquo;Your business in England,&rdquo; she said, as unconcernedly as might be&mdash;&ldquo;it
      is that, I take it, which causes so much anxiety. Fortunately it is soon
      to be settled&mdash;to-morrow, I think you said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I might tell you about it,&rdquo; he responded with frank fervency. &ldquo;I
      wish it&mdash;you cannot imagine how much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The look with which she received his words recalled to him her earlier
      manner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;&rdquo; she began, in a measured voice, and then
      stopped. Intuition helped him to read in her face the coming of a softer
      mood. Finally she smiled a little. &ldquo;Really, this is all very quaint,&rdquo; she
      said, and the smile crept into her voice. &ldquo;But the train is slowing down&mdash;there
      is no time now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were indeed moving through the street of a town, at a pace which had
      been insensibly lowered while they talked. The irregular outlines of docks
      and boat-slips, overhanging greenish water, revealed themselves between
      dingy houses covered with signs and posters. At the barriers crossing the
      streets were clustered groups of philosophic observers, headed by the
      inevitable young soldier with his hands in the pockets of his red
      trousers, and flanked by those brown old women in white caps who seem
      always to be unoccupied, yet mysteriously do everything that is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Dieppe, then?&rdquo; he asked, with a collecting hand put out for his
      wraps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train had halted, and doors were being opened for tickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We sit still, here, and go on to the wharf,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then to the boat!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;How long is it?&mdash;the voyage on the
      boat, I mean. Three hours and over! Excellent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed outright as she rose, and got together her books and papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were a Frenchman when I first saw you,&rdquo; she confided to him
      over her shoulder. &ldquo;But no Frenchman at Dieppe ever yet shouted
      &lsquo;Excellent!&rsquo; with his face turned toward the New Haven steamers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mirth in her tone was so welcome to him that he laughed in turn,
      without any clear idea of her words. He gathered her handbag up along with
      his own, and when she demurred he offered her gay defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the terrible boldness of a timid person,&rdquo; he prattled, as he helped
      her down the steps, &ldquo;but you must perceive that in the face of it you are
      quite helpless. Since I was born, I have never really had my own way
      before. But now I begin to believe in my star. After all, one is not an
      Englishman for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is comparatively easy to be an Englishman in Dieppe,&rdquo; she made
      answer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he sky was dappled
      azure overhead, the water calm and fresh-hued below. When the ship&rsquo;s
      company had disposed itself, and the vessel was making way outside, there
      were numerous long gaps of unpeopled space on the windy side, and to one
      of these the young couple tacitly bent their steps. They leaned against
      the rail, standing close together, with their faces lifted to the strong
      sweet breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viewed thus side by side, it could be seen that of the two the young man
      was just perceptibly the taller, but his extreme fragility excused his
      companion&rsquo;s conception of him as a small man. On his head he had pulled
      tight for the voyage a little turban of a cap, which accentuated the
      foreign note of his features and expression. He was dark of skin and hair,
      with deep-brown eyes both larger and softer than is common with his sex,
      even in the South. The face, high and regular in shape, had in repose the
      careworn effect of maturer years than the boyish figure indicated. In the
      animation of discussion this face took on, for the most part, the rather
      somber brilliancy of a strenuous earnestness. Now, as it confronted the
      stiff Channel wind, it was illumined by the unaccustomed light of a
      frivolous mood. The ends of his slight mustache were lifted in a
      continuous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my gayest day for many, many years,&rdquo; he told her, after a little
      pause in the talk. They had become great friends in this last half-hour.
      In the reaction from the questionable restraint of the coupé to the broad,
      sunlit freedom of the steamer&rsquo;s deck, the girl had revealed in generous
      measure a side of her temperament for which he had been unprepared. She
      had a humorous talent, and, once she had gained a clew to his perceptive
      capacities in this direction, it had pleased her to make him laugh by
      droll accounts of her experiences and observations in Paris. She had been
      there for a fortnight&rsquo;s holiday, quite by herself, she told him, and there
      was something in her tone which rendered it impossible for him to ask
      himself if this was at all unusual among English young ladies. His
      knowledge of Paris was also that of a stranger, and he followed her
      whimsical narrative of blunders and odd mistakes with a zest heightened by
      a recollection of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When have I laughed so much before?&rdquo; he cried now. A long sigh, as of
      surprised relief, followed his words. &ldquo;Well&mdash;I had looked forward to
      coming in a different spirit to England. With some hopes and a good
      courage&mdash;yes. But with a merry heart&mdash;how could I have foretold
      that? It was my good angel who put that coupé ticket into my head, and so
      brought me to you. Ah, how angry you were! I see you now, pulling at that
      door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; she said in extenuation, &ldquo;how could I know? I never dreamed
      that the whole coupé was not mine&mdash;and when I saw that odious guard
      opening the door, to force in some wretched little Continental creature&mdash;I
      mean, that was my momentary thought&mdash;and naturally I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An involuntary sidelong glance of his eyes upward toward the crown of her
      hat, passed mute comment on her unfinished remark. She bit her lip in
      self-reproof at sight of the dusky flush on his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the only un-English thing about me,&rdquo; he said, with a pathetically
      proud attempt at a smile. &ldquo;My father was a tall, big man, and so is my
      brother Salvator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A new consciousness of the susceptibility of this young man to slights and
      wounds spread in the girl&rsquo;s mind. It was so cruelly easy to prick his thin
      skin! But it was correspondingly easy to soothe and charm him&mdash;and
      that was the better part. His character and temperament mapped themselves
      out before her mind&rsquo;s eye. She read him as at once innocent and
      complicated. He could be full of confidence in a stranger, like herself,
      but his doubts about his own values were distressing. The uneased antennæ
      of his self-consciousness were extended in all directions, as if to
      solicit injury. She had caught in his brown eyes the suggestion of an
      analogy to a friendless spaniel&mdash;the capacity for infinite gratitude
      united with conviction that only kicks were to be expected. It was more
      helpful to liken him to a woman. In the gentle and timid soul of a
      convent-bred maiden he nourished the stormy ambitions of a leader of men.
      It was a nun who boldly dreamed of commanding on the field of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a feeling,&rdquo; she said to him, so softly that the tone was almost
      tender, &ldquo;that you must be like your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rightly judged him to be her elder, but for the moment her mood was
      absorbingly maternal. &ldquo;Let us sit down here,&rdquo; she added, moving toward the
      bench facing the rail. &ldquo;You were going to tell me&mdash;about her, was
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spread his rugs over their knees as they sat together in the fresh
      wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it was not so much of her,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have much to think about her&mdash;not much to put into words. She died
      five years ago&mdash;nearly six now&mdash;and I was so much at school that
      I saw very little of her in the latter years. Salvator was with her
      always, though, to the end, although he was not her own son. We are
      half-brothers, but no one could have been fonder than he was of my mother,
      or a better son to her. After she died, he still kept me in school, and
      this was curious too, because he hated all my teachers bitterly. Salvator
      is fierce against the church, yet he kept me where I had been put years
      before, with the Christian Brothers at the Bon Rencontre, in Toulon. When
      at last I left them, Salvator took me with him for a period&mdash;he is an
      expert and a dealer in gems&mdash;and then I became a private tutor. Four
      years or so of that&mdash;and now I am here.&rdquo; He added, as upon an
      afterthought: &ldquo;You must not think that I failed to love my mother. She was
      sweet and good, and very tender to me, and I used to weep a great deal
      after I left her, but it was not my fortune to be so much with her as
      Salvator was. I think of her, but there is not much to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The repetition of this formula suggested no comment to his companion, and
      he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The real memory of my childhood is my father, although I saw him only
      once. Salvator says I saw him oftener, but if so all the recollections
      jumble themselves together in my mind, to make a single impression. I was
      five years old; it was in the early summer, in 1875. My father had been
      fighting against the Prussians when I was born. By the time I was old
      enough to know people, he was away in Spain with Don Carlos. He died
      there, of wounds and fever, at Seo de Urgel, in August of that same year,
      1875. But first he came to see us&mdash;it would have been in June, I
      think&mdash;and we were living at Cannes. He had some secret Carlist
      business, Salvator says. I knew nothing of that. I know only that I saw
      him, and understood very well who he was, and fixed him in my mind so that
      I should never, never forget him. How strange a thing it is about
      children! I have only the dimmest general idea of how my mother looked
      when I was that age; I cannot remember her at all in the odd clothes which
      her pictures show she wore then, though I saw them constantly. Yet my
      father comes once and I carry his image till Judgment Day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor mothers!&rdquo; sighed the girl, under her breath. &ldquo;No, it was nothing. Go
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that he was a soldier, and that wherever there were wars he went
      to have his share of fighting. I suppose it was this which gripped my
      imagination, even as a baby. I could read when I was five, and Salvator
      had told me about our father&rsquo;s battles. He had been in the Mutiny in
      India, and he was in Sicily against Garibaldi, and he was with the
      Austrians four years before I was born, and in the French Foreign Legion
      afterward. I think I knew all this when I saw him&mdash;and if I did not,
      then I feel that I could have learned it from just looking at him. He was
      like a statue of War. Ah, how I remember him&mdash;the tall, strong,
      straight, dark, hardfaced, silent man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you loved <i>him!</i>&rdquo; commented his companion, with significance.

    <p>
      He shook his head smilingly. The analysis in retrospect of his own
      childish emotions had a pleasant interest for him. &ldquo;No; there was no
      question of love, at all. For example, he liked Salvator&mdash;who was
      then a big boy of fifteen&mdash;and he took him off to Spain with him when
      he left. I cannot remember that he so much as put his hand on my head, or
      paid the slightest attention to me. He looked at me in a grave way if I
      put myself in front of his eyes, just as he looked at other things, but he
      would not turn his eyes to follow me if I moved aside. Do you know that to
      my fancy that was superb? I was not in the least jealous of Salvator. I
      only said to myself that when I was his age, I also would march to fight
      in my father&rsquo;s battles. And I was proud that he did not bend to me, or put
      himself out to please me, this huge, cold-eyed, lion-like father of mine.
      If he had ever kissed me I should have been ashamed&mdash;for us both. But
      nothing was farther from his thoughts. He went away, and at the door he
      spoke for the first time in my hearing of me. He twisted his thumb toward
      me, where I stood in the shelter of my mother&rsquo;s skirts. Mind, he&rsquo;s an
      Englishman! he said&mdash;and turned on his heel. I have the words in my
      ears still. &lsquo;Mind, he&rsquo;s an Englishman!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There <i>is</i> England!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood up, and his eager eye, following the guidance of her finger,
      found the faint, broken, thin line of white on the distant water&rsquo;s edge.
      Above it, as if they were a part of it, hung in a figured curtain soft
      clouds which were taking on a rosy tint from the declining sun. He gazed
      at the remote prospect in silence, but with a quickened breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the first time that <i>I</i> have seen it like this&mdash;coming
      toward it, I mean, from somewhere else,&rdquo; she remarked at last. &ldquo;I had
      never been outside England before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not seem to hear her. With another lingering, clinging gaze at the
      white speck, he shook himself a little, and turned. &ldquo;And now I want to
      tell you about this new, wonderful thing&mdash;about why I am this minute
      within sight of England. You will say it is very strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They moved to their bench again, and he spread the wraps once more, but
      this time they did not sit quite so close together. It was as if the mere
      sight of that pale, respectable slip of land on the horizon had in some
      subtle way affected their relation to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week ago,&rdquo; he began afresh, &ldquo;at Nice, a messenger from the Crédit
      Lyonnais brought me a note saying they wished to see me at the bank. They
      had, it seems, searched for me in several towns along the Riviera, because
      I had been moving about. It was demanded that I should prove my identity
      by witnesses, and when that was done I was given a sum of money, and a
      sealed letter addressed to me, bearing simply my name, Mr. Christian Tower&mdash;nothing
      more. I hurried outside and read its contents. I was requested to get
      together all my papers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short, arrested by a sharp, half-stifled exclamation from her
      lips. She had continued looking at him after his mention of his name&mdash;at
      first absent-mindedly, as if something in his talk had sent her thoughts
      unconsciously astray; then with lifted head, and brows bent together in
      evident concentration upon some new phase of what he had been saying. Now
      she interrupted him with visible excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say Christian Tower!&rdquo; She pushed the words at him hurriedly. &ldquo;What
      was your father&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was always known as Captain Tower, but I have read it in my papers&mdash;his
      first name was Ambrose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had risen to her feet, in evident agitation, and now strode across to
      the rail. As he essayed to follow her, she turned, and forced the shadow
      of a smile into her lips; her eyes remained frightened. &ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo;
       she said with a gasping attempt at reassurance. &ldquo;I was queer for just an
      instant; it&rsquo;s all right. Go on, please. You were to get together your
      papers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And bring them to Brighton,&rdquo; he said, much disconcerted. &ldquo;That is all.
      But won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I would rather stand,&rdquo; she answered. Her composure was returning,
      and with it the power to view altogether, and in their proper relation to
      one another, the several elements of the situation his words had revealed
      to her. Upon examination, it was curiosity that she felt rather than
      personal concern&mdash;an astonished and most exigent curiosity. But even
      before this, it grew apparent to her as she thought, came her honorable
      duty to this young man who had confided in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I ought to tell you,&rdquo; she began, beckoning him nearer where she
      stood; &ldquo;yes, you should be told that in all human probability I know the
      story. It is impossible that I should be mistaken&mdash;two such names
      never got together by accident. And I can assure you that the whole thing
      is even more extraordinary and astounding than you can possibly imagine.
      There are people in England who will curl up like leaves thrown on the
      fire when they see you. But for the moment&rdquo;&mdash;she paused, with a
      perplexed face and hesitating voice&mdash;&ldquo;go on; tell me a little more.
      It isn&rsquo;t clear to me&mdash;how much you know. Don&rsquo;t be afraid; I will be
      entirely frank with you, when you have finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He patted the rail nervously with his hand, and stared at her in pained
      bewilderment and impatience. &ldquo;How much do I know?&rdquo; he faltered vaguely.
      &ldquo;Very little; almost nothing. There was no explanation in the letter. The
      bankers said nothing, save that they were to give me a thousand francs.
      But one does not get a thousand francs merely because the wind has
      changed. There must be a reason for it; and what reason is possible except
      that there is some inheritance for me? So I argued it out&mdash;to myself.
      I have thought of nothing else, awake or asleep, for the whole week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He halted, with anxious appeal in his eyes, and his hands outspread to
      beseech enlightenment from her. She nodded to show that she understood.
      &ldquo;In a minute or two, when I have got it into shape in my mind,&rdquo; she said
      soothingly. &ldquo;But meantime go on. I want you to talk. What have you done
      during the week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian threw his hands outward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done?&rdquo; he asked plaintively. &ldquo;Murdered time some way or the other. I was
      free to move an hour after I had read the letter. The money was more than
      I had ever had before. It was intolerable to me&mdash;the thought of not
      being in motion. In the &lsquo;Indicateur&rsquo; I got the times of trains, and I
      formed my plan. Avignon I had never seen, and then Le Puy&mdash;there was
      a wonderful description of it in a magazine I had read&mdash;and then to
      Paris, and next to Rouen. It was at Rouen that I slept last night. It was
      my first night&rsquo;s good sleep&mdash;I had tired myself out so completely.
      Always walking with the map in my mind, going from one church to another,
      talking to the Suisse, bending back my head to examine capitals and
      arches, forcing myself to take an interest in what I saw every little
      minute&mdash;so I have come somehow through the week. But now here is rich
      England within plain sight, and here are you, my new friend&mdash;and all
      my life I have been so poor and without friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tightened his hand upon the rail, and abruptly turned his face away.
      She saw the shine of tears in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and sit down again,&rdquo; she said, with a sisterly hand on his arm. &ldquo;I
      know how to tell it to you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you truly know nothing about the Towers&mdash;or Torrs&mdash;your
      father&rsquo;s family?&rdquo; she continued, when they were once again seated. &ldquo;It
      sounds incredible! I can hardly realize how you could have lived all these
      years and not&mdash;but how old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;And not got some inkling of who&mdash;of who your father was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother never told me. Perhaps she did not know altogether, herself. I
      cannot say as to that. And if Salvator knew&mdash;that I cannot tell,
      either. He is a curious man, my brother Salvator. He talks so you would
      think you saw him inside out&mdash;but he keeps many things to himself
      none the less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that brother of yours,&rdquo; she said abstractedly. &ldquo;I have been
      thinking about him. But it can&rsquo;t be that he has any importance in the
      game, else the Jews would have sent for him instead of you. They waste no
      time,&mdash;they make no errors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Jews!&rdquo; he murmured at her, with no comprehension in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &ldquo;I have been arranging it in my mind. The thing was like a
      black fog to me when you first spoke. I had to search about for a light
      before I could make a start. But when I stumbled across the thought, &lsquo;It
      is the Jews&rsquo; work,&rsquo; then it was not very hard to make out the rest. I
      could almost tell you who it is that is to meet you at Brighton. It is Mr.
      Soman. Is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He assented with an impulsive movement of head and hands. The gaze that he
      fixed upon her sparkled with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is Lord Julius&rsquo; man of business,&rdquo; she explained to his further
      mystification. &ldquo;No doubt he has had one of those green eyes of his on you
      ever since you were a fortnight old. It frightens one to think of it&mdash;the
      merciless and unerring precision of their system. Is there anything they
      <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid of Jews myself,&rdquo; he faltered, striving to connect himself
      with what he dimly perceived of her mood. &ldquo;But what have they against me?
      What can they do to me? I owe nothing; they can&rsquo;t make me responsible for
      what other people, strangers to me, have done, can they? And why should
      they give me a thousand francs? It is I,&rdquo; he finished hopelessly, &ldquo;I who
      am in the black fog. Tell me, I beg you, what is it that they want with
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put a reassuring hand upon his arm, and the steady, genial light in
      her calm eyes brought him instantaneous solace. &ldquo;You have not the
      slightest cause for fear,&rdquo; she told him, gently. &ldquo;Quite the contrary. They
      are not going to hurt you. So far from it, they have taken you up; they
      will wrap you in cotton-wool and nurse you as if you were the Koh-i-noor
      diamond. You may rest easy, my dear sir; you may close your eyes, and fold
      your hands, and lean back against Israel as heavily as you like. It is all
      right so far as you are concerned. But the others&rdquo;&mdash;she paused, and
      looked seaward with lifted brows and a mouth twisted to express sardonic
      comment upon some amazing new outlook&mdash;&ldquo;eye-ee! the others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still you do not tell me!&rdquo; For the first time she caught in his voice the
      hint of a virile, and even an imperious note. Behind the half-petulant
      entreaty of the tired boy, there was a man&rsquo;s spirit of dictation. She
      deferred to it unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord Julius that I spoke of is&mdash;let me see&mdash;he is your
      great-uncle&mdash;your grandfather&rsquo;s younger brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if <i>he</i> is a Jew&mdash;&rdquo; began Christian, in an awed whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no; he is nothing of the sort. That is to say, he is not Jewish
      in blood. But he married a great heiress of the race&mdash;whole millions
      sterling came to him from the huge fortune of the Aronsons in Holland&mdash;and
      he likes Jewish people&mdash;of the right sort. He is an old man now, and
      his son, Emanuel, has immense influence over him. You should see them
      sitting together like two love-birds on a perch. They idolize each other,
      and they both worship Emanuel&rsquo;s wife. If they weren&rsquo;t the two best men in
      the world, and if she weren&rsquo;t the most remarkable woman anywhere, they
      would utterly spoil her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;this lord&mdash;is my great-uncle,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian recalled her to his subject. &ldquo;He and his son are good men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are the ones I referred to as the Jews. That is how they are spoken
      of in the family&mdash;to distinguish them from the senior branch&mdash;the
      sons and grandsons of your grandfather. Fix that distinction in you mind.
      There is the elder group, who have titles and miles of mortgaged estates,
      no money to speak of and still less brains&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the group that I belong to?&rdquo; He offered the interruption with a
      little twinkle in his eyes. It was patent that his self-possession had
      returned. Even this limited and tentative measure of identification with
      the most desirable and deep-rooted realities in that wonderful island that
      he could see coming nearer to meet him, had sufficed to quell the restless
      flutter of his nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded with a responsive gleam of sportiveness on her face. &ldquo;Yes, your
      place in it is a very curious one. But first get this clear in your mind&mdash;that
      the younger group, whom they speak of as the Jews, have money beyond
      counting, and have morals and intelligence moreover. Between these two
      groups no love is lost. In fact, they hate each other. The difference is
      the Christians go about cursing the Jews, whereas the Jews wisely shrug
      their shoulders and say nothing. No one suspected that they would <i>do</i>
      anything, either&mdash;but&mdash;oh, this is going to be an awful
      business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held himself down to a fine semblance of dignified calm. &ldquo;Tell me
      more,&rdquo; he bade her, with an effect of temperate curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now comes tragedy,&rdquo; she went on, and the hint of sprightliness
      disappeared from her face and tone. &ldquo;It is really one of the most terrible
      stories that could be told. There is a very aged man&mdash;he must be
      nearly ninety&mdash;lying at death&rsquo;s door in his great seat in Shropshire.
      He is at death&rsquo;s door, I said, but he has the strength and will of a
      giant, and though he is half paralyzed, half blind, half everything, still
      he has his weight against the door, and no one knows how long he can hold
      it closed. It is your grandfather that I am speaking of. His name also is
      Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man nodded gravely. &ldquo;My father would have fought death that way
      too, if they had not shot him to pieces, and heaped fever on top of that,&rdquo;
       he commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl bit her lip and flushed awkwardly for an instant &ldquo;Let me go on,&rdquo;
       she said then, and hurried forward. &ldquo;This old man had three sons&mdash;not
      counting the priest, Lord David, who doesn&rsquo;t come into the thing. The
      first of these sons, also Christian, had three sons, and he and they were
      all alive six months ago. They are all dead now, two drowned in their
      yacht, one lost in the &lsquo;Castle Drummond,&rsquo; one killed in Matabeleland. Lord
      David, the priest, the next brother, died last year&mdash;childless of
      course. There remained in England two sons of another brother who died
      some years ago, Lord Edward, and this horrible mowing down of human lives
      left them apparently nearest to the very aged man, your grandfather. Do
      you follow all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; said Christian. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t I will pick it up afterward.
      In mercy&rsquo;s name, do not stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Jews, saying nothing, had lost sight of nothing. There was still
      another brother who had lived abroad for many years, who died abroad
      twenty years ago. You are getting to the climax now. The Jews must have
      kept an eye on this wandering cousin of theirs; it is evident they knew he
      left a son capable of inheriting, and that they did not let this son
      escape from view. Because Lord Ambrose Torr was older than Lord Edward,
      his brother, it happens now that the son of that Ambrose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man abruptly rose, and moved along to the rail. He had signified
      by a rapid backward gesture of the hand his momentary craving for
      solitude; he stretched this hand now slowly, as if unconsciously, toward
      the sunset glow on sky and sea, in the heart of which lay imbedded a thick
      line of cream-colored cliffs, escalloped under a close covering of soft
      olive-hued verdure. The profile of his uplifted face, as he gazed thus
      before him into the light, seemed to the eyes of the girl transfigured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood thus, rapt and motionless, for minutes, until her mind had time
      to formulate the suspicion that this was all intolerable play-acting, and
      to dismiss it again as unworthy. Then he returned all at once to her side,
      apparently with a shamefaced kind of perception of her thoughts. He was
      flushed and uneasy, and shuffled his hands in and out of the pockets of
      his great-coat. He did not seat himself, but stood looking down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is my grandfather?&rdquo; he asked, with a husky, difficult voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duke of Glastonbury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; he began, hesitatingly; &ldquo;it is not clear to me
      about my father. Why should he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose in turn, with swift decision, as if she had been alertly watching
      for the question. &ldquo;That is what you must not ask me,&rdquo; she said, hurriedly.
      &ldquo;I think I will move about a little. The wind is colder here. I am getting
      chilled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They strolled about together, conducting a fitful conversation, but as
      often gazing in silence at the bulk of the headlands they were
      approaching, gray and massive now in the evening light. She answered
      freely enough the queries he put, but between these he lapsed into an
      abstraction which she respected. More than once he spoke of the
      extraordinary confusion into which her story had thrown his thoughts, and
      she philosophically replied that she could well understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later they had passed the fatuous inspection of the customs
      people, and confronted the imminence of leave-taking. Constraint enveloped
      them as in a mantle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred suddenly to him to say: &ldquo;How strange! You possess the most
      extraordinary knowledge of me and my&mdash;my people, and yet the thought
      just comes to me&mdash;I have not so much as asked your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him with a new light in her eyes, half kind, half ironically
      roguish. &ldquo;If I may confess it, there have been times today when I was
      annoyed with you for being so persistently and indefatigably interested in
      yourself&mdash;for never dreaming of wondering, speculating, inquiring
      something about me. But that was very weak of me&mdash;I see it now&mdash;and
      very wise of you, because&mdash;what does it matter about a nobody like
      me?&mdash;but next week the whole world will be bearing witness that you
      are the most interesting young man in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a swift glance down the train toward the guards noisily shutting
      the doors. &ldquo;No, it is too bad,&rdquo; he said, nervously. &ldquo;You will always be my
      first friend in England&mdash;my very deeply prized friend everywhere. I
      know you only to-day&mdash;but that day is more to me than all the rest of
      my life&mdash;and it is full of you. They are closing the doors&mdash;but
      you will tell me? The notion of not seeing you again is ridiculous. You
      are in London&mdash;yes?&mdash;then how do you think I could come to
      London without first of all, before everything else, wanting to call upon
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I daresay we shall meet again,&rdquo; she answered, as perforce he stepped
      into the compartment. Her smile had a puzzling quality in it&mdash;something
      compounded, it seemed to him, of both fear and fun. &ldquo;In a remote kind of
      way I am mixed up with the story myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no time for any hope of further explanation. He put his head out
      of the window, and shook hands again. &ldquo;Remember!&rdquo; he called out fervently.
      &ldquo;You are my first friend in England. Whenever&mdash;whatever I can do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even to the half of your kingdom!&rdquo; she laughed at him, as the movement of
      the carriage drew him past her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone of these last words, which he bore away with him, had been gay&mdash;almost
      jovial. But the girl, when she had watched him pass out of sight, turned
      and walked slowly off in the direction of her own train with a white and
      troubled face.

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>any builders in
      their day have put a hand to the making of Caermere Hall. Though there
      were wide differences of race and language among them and though the long
      chain of time which binds them together has generations and even centuries
      for its links, they seem to have had thus much in common: they were all at
      feud with the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the very pick of summer days, when the densest thickets of Clune Forest
      are alive to the core with moving green reflections of the outer radiance,
      and hints of the glory up above pierce their way to the bottom of the
      narrowest ravine through which the black Devon churns and frets, somehow
      Caermere remains wrapped in its ancient shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first men, in some forgotten time, laid its foundations with no
      thought save of the pass at the foot to be defended. Later artificers
      reared thick walls upon these foundations, pushed out towered curtains,
      sank wells, lifted the keep, cut slits of corner windows or crowned the
      fabric with new turrets for watchmen, each after the need or fashion of
      his age, but all with minds single to the idea of blocking the path that
      Caermere overhung. In due time came the breath of the king&rsquo;s peace,
      blowing equably over the vexed marches, albeit loaded with the scent of
      gunpowder, and my lords slowly put aside their iron harness for silken
      jackets, and unslung the herses in their gateways. Men of skill set now
      about the task of expanding the turfed spaces within the inclosure, of
      spreading terraces and forming gardens, of turning stone chambers into
      dames&rsquo; apartments, and sullen guard-rooms into banquet-halls. Their
      grandsons, in turn, pulled down even more than they erected; where the
      mightiest walls had shouldered their huge bulk, these men of Elizabeth and
      James left thin façades of brickwork, and beams of oak set in a trivial
      plaster casing. The old barbican was not broad enough to span their new
      roadway, stretching to the valley below over the track of the former
      military path, and they blew it up; the pleasure-ground, which they
      extended by moving far backward the wall of the tilting yard, was bare of
      aspect to their eye, and they planted it with yews and, later, with cedars
      from the Lebanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all these changes, Caermere remained upon its three sides shadowed
      by great hills, and the thought of making wide windows in the walls on the
      open fourth side came to no one. When at last, in the earlier Georgian
      time, the venerable piles of bastioned masonry here were replaced by a
      feebly polite front of lath and stucco, windows were indeed cut to the
      very floor, in the French style, but meanwhile the trees had grown into a
      high screen against the sky, and it was not in the Torr blood to level
      timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a house and family have lived together for a thousand years, it is
      but reasonable that they should have come to an understanding with each
      other. Was Caermere dark because the mood of the Torrs, its makers and
      masters, had from the dawn of things been saturnine? Or did the Torrs owe
      their historic gloom and dourness of temperament to the influence of this
      somber cradle of their race? There is record of the query having been put,
      in a spirit of banter, by a gentleman who rode over Clune bridge in the
      train of King John. Of convincing answer there is none to this latest day.
      The Torrs are a dark folk, and Caermere is a dark house. They belong to
      one another and that is all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, on the first morning of October, a gray and overcast morning even on
      the hilltops, and though it was past the half-hour towards nine, there was
      barely light enough to see one&rsquo;s way about by in the big breakfast-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall young man in rough, light-brown clothes stood at one of the
      windows, drumming idly on the glass and staring at the black cedars beyond
      the lawn. At intervals he whistled under his breath, in a sulky fashion,
      some primitive snatches of an unknown tune. Once or twice he yawned, and
      then struck a vicious ring from the panes with his hard nails, in
      protesting comment upon his boredom.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the large fireplace behind him were dishes huddled for heat, and
      their metallic gleam in the flicker of the flames was repeated farther
      away in the points of red on the plate and glass of the long breakfast
      table spread in the center of the room. From time to time a white-faced
      youngster in livery entered the room, performed some mysterious service at
      the hearth or the table in the dim twilight and went out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man at the window paid no heed to the goings and comings of the
      servant, but when the door opened presently and another tweed-clad figure
      entered, his ear told him the difference on the instant, and he half
      turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, what are you all doing?&rdquo; he growled angrily. &ldquo;I said eight&mdash;you
      heard me!&mdash;sharp eight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>does</i> it matter?&rdquo; protested the newcomer, stooping at the
      fire-place to lift the covers from the dishes in a languid inspection of
      their contents. He yawned as he spoke. &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t let fellows go to bed
      till four, how the devil do you expect them to be down at eight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that you, Pirie?&rdquo; said the man at the window. &ldquo;I thought it was my
      brother.&rdquo; The other stood for a moment, with his back to the fire. Then he
      lounged to the window, stretching his arms as he moved. He also was tall,
      but with a scattering of gray in his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beastly black morning,&rdquo; he commented in drowsy tones, after a prolonged
      observation of the prospect. &ldquo;Might as well stopped in bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go back then!&rdquo; snapped the other. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t make the rotten
      weather, did I?&rdquo; This was wanton ill-temper. The elder man also began
      drumming with his nails on the window. &ldquo;Turn it up, Eddy,&rdquo; he
      remonstrated, smoothly enough, but with a latent snarl in his tone. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger man moved his head, as if he would have looked his companion
      in the face. Then he stared away again, out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beaters been waitin&rsquo; half an hour already,&rdquo; he grumbled, sulkily. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      the good of makin&rsquo; a time if you don&rsquo;t keep it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t make any time,&rdquo; responded Major Pirie with curtness. Upon
      reflection, he added: &ldquo;What does it matter about the beaters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There seemed no answer to this, and for several minutes nothing was said.
      Finally the younger man thought of something. &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he began, and after
      an instant&rsquo;s pause went on: &ldquo;It&rsquo;d suit me better not to be called &lsquo;Eddy&rsquo;
      among the men, d&rsquo;ye see? That fellow Burlington began it last night&mdash;he
      got it from you&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t like it. When we&rsquo;re alone, of course,
      that&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Major Pirie laughed&mdash;a dry, brief, harsh laugh&mdash;and swung around
      on his heels. &ldquo;Your man didn&rsquo;t get those sausages I asked for, after all,&rdquo;
       he remarked, going back to the dishes at the fender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Edward, &ldquo;or else,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t. I
      never saw such a houseful of brutes and duffers. I&rsquo;m keen to shunt the lot
      of &lsquo;em, and they know it, the beggars. You&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d try to suck up
      to me, but they don&rsquo;t, they haven&rsquo;t got brains enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The major had brought a plate from the table, and was filling it from
      under the covers on the hearth. &ldquo;Shall I ring for the tea?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Edward moved across to the chimney corner and pulled the cord himself.
      &ldquo;Do you know what that old ass, Barlow&mdash;the butler, you know&mdash;had
      the face to say to me yesterday? &lsquo;I&rsquo;&mdash;God, you couldn&rsquo;t believe it!
      &lsquo;I &rsquo;ope, sir,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll think better of shootin&rsquo; on the
      First, for His Grace&rsquo;ll hear the guns in the covers, and it won&rsquo;t do His
      Grace no good.&rsquo; Fancy the beggar&rsquo;s cheek!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you know, Torr,&rdquo; said Major Pirie, slowly, speaking with his
      mouth full but contriving to give a significantly nice emphasis to the
      name, &ldquo;I was thinkin&rsquo; much the same myself. For that matter, several of
      the fellows were mentionin&rsquo; it. It doesn&rsquo;t look quite the thing, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The entrance of the servant created an interval of silence, during which
      Mr. Edward in his turn rummaged among the dishes before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Gus, is it?&rdquo; he demanded, from where he knelt on one knee, plate in
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thought it would be funny to queer my game, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother hasn&rsquo;t said a word, so far&rsquo;s I know,&rdquo; replied the major,
      pouring his tea. &ldquo;It was merely some of the fellows, talkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God Almighty!&rdquo; cried Mr. Edward, springing to his feet. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a
      precious outfit of pals for you! You come down here, so help me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;you&rsquo;; say &lsquo;they,&rsquo; if you&rsquo;ve got to say anything,&rdquo; interposed
      the major, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they, then,&rdquo; the other went on, in loud heat. &ldquo;They come down here,
      and take my mounts, by God; they drink my wine, they win my money, they
      drain me dry&mdash;and then they go behind my back and whisper to one
      another that I&rsquo;m an outsider. And you too, Pirie,&rdquo; he continued, with
      defiance and deprecation mingled in his tone, &ldquo;you admit yourself that you
      talked with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Torr,&rdquo; replied the major, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a mistake for you to turn out so
      early. You&rsquo;ve tried to quarrel before breakfast every day I&rsquo;ve been here.
      It&rsquo;s the worst morning temper I ever heard of in my life. You ought to
      have tea and eggs and things brought to you in your room, and not show
      yourself for at least two hours afterward&mdash;you really ought. It isn&rsquo;t
      fair to your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and still another tall man came in. He nodded to Pirie as
      he passed him, with a tolerant &ldquo;Well, major,&rdquo; and went straight to the
      dishes by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pirie&rsquo;s got it into his head we oughtn&rsquo;t to shoot to-day, Gus,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other rose with a dish in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> dark,&rdquo; he assented, glancing toward the window. &ldquo;Afraid of
      pottin&rsquo; a beater, major?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;it&rsquo;s about the duke,&rdquo; explained Edward. &ldquo;It seems some of the
      fellows funk the thing&mdash;they think he&rsquo;ll hear the guns&mdash;they
      want to go to church instead, or something of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Augustine Torr, M.P., looked at his brother inquiringly. The tie of blood
      between them was obvious enough. They were both slender as well as tall;
      their small round heads merging indistinguishably behind into flat, broad
      necks, seemed identical in contour; they had the same light coarse hair,
      the same florid skins, even the same little yellow mustaches. The
      differences were harder to seek. Edward, though he had borne Her Majesty&rsquo;s
      commission for some years, was not so well set up about the shoulders as
      his younger and civilian brother. Augustine, on the other hand, despite
      his confident carriage of himself, produced the effect of being Edward&rsquo;s
      inferior in simple force of character. It was at once to his credit and
      his disparagement that he had the more amiable nature of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean&mdash;the duke?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Is there a change?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edward put out his closed lips a little, and shook his head. Major Pirie
      sprinkled salt on his muffin while he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All there is of it is this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There was just an idea that with
      the&mdash;with your grandfather&mdash;dyin&rsquo; in the house&mdash;it might
      look a little better to give the first the go-by. Nobody&rsquo;d have a word to
      say against shootin&rsquo; to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but what the hell&rdquo;&mdash;Augustine groped his way with hesitancy&mdash;&ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been shootin&rsquo; partridges for a month, and how
      are pheasants any different? And as for the duke&mdash;why, of course
      one&rsquo;s sorry and all that&mdash;but he&rsquo;s been dyin&rsquo; since June, and the
      birds have some rights&mdash;or rather, I should say&mdash;what I mean is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said,&rdquo; put in Edward, to cover the collapse of his
      brother&rsquo;s argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Pirie frowned a little. &ldquo;Partridges are another matter,&rdquo; he said
      testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damned if I know what you&rsquo;re driving at,&rdquo; avowed Augustine. He paused
      with fork in air at his own words. &ldquo;Drivin&rsquo; at,&rdquo; he repeated
      painstakingly. &ldquo;Drivin&rsquo; at pheasants, eh? Not bad, you know. Pass the
      mustard, Pirie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; said the major, with gloom. &ldquo;You know well enough what I mean. To
      work through fields miles off&mdash;that&rsquo;s one thing. To shoot the covers
      here under the duke&rsquo;s nose, with the beaters messin&rsquo; about&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      quite another. However that&rsquo;s your affair, not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; urged Augustine, &ldquo;what difference does a day make?
      There&rsquo;ll be just as much racket to-morrow as to-day. It isn&rsquo;t reasonable,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was merely what you might call a sentiment,&rdquo; said the major, in the
      half apologetic tone of a man admitting defeat. He looked the least
      sentimental of warriors as he went on with his breakfast&mdash;a
      longfaced, weather-beaten, dull-eyed man of the late forties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four other men who came in now at brief intervals, with few or no words of
      salutation to the company, and who lounged about helping themselves to
      what caught their fancy in the breakfast, were equally removed from the
      suspicion of adding a sentimental element to the atmosphere. They made
      little talk of any kind, and no mention whatever of that absurd qualm
      about the First which had been reported to have germinated among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward had reached the stage of filling his pipe. Walking to the mantel
      for a light, it occurred to him to ring the bell first. &ldquo;Her ladyship
      breakfastin&rsquo; in her room?&rdquo; he asked the youngster who answered the
      summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her ladyship&rsquo;s woman has just gone up with it, sir,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> all right,&rdquo; said Edward, and forthwith struck the match.
      &ldquo;Send in Davis and Morton to me, and ask Barlow for those Brazilian cigars
      of mine&mdash;the small huntin&rsquo; ones. What wheels were those I heard on
      the gravel? If it&rsquo;s the traps we shan&rsquo;t want them to-day. We&rsquo;re walkin&rsquo;
      across.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make inquiries, sir,&rdquo; said the domestic, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room had brightened perceptibly, and Captain Edward was in a better
      temper. He moved over to the sideboard and filled a pocket-flask from one
      of the decanters in the old-fashioned case. As an afterthought, he also
      filled a small glass, and gulped its contents neat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re off in ten
      minutes now,&rdquo; he called out to the men about the table, some of whom had
      already lit their pipes. &ldquo;What do you fellows want to take with you? My
      tip is this rum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly cold enough for rum, is it?&rdquo; asked one, drifting languidly toward
      the sideboard. Most of the others had risen to their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slender, sad-faced, gentlemanly-looking old man in evening clothes had
      entered the room, and stood now at Captain Edward&rsquo;s elbow and touched it
      with his hand. &ldquo;I&mdash;beg&mdash;your&mdash;pardon&mdash;sir,&rdquo; he said,
      in the conventional phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward, listening to what a companion was saying, turned absent-mindedly
      to the butler. Then he happened to remember something. &ldquo;Damn you, Barlow,
      you get duller every day!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;You know perfectly well what
      cigars I take out of doors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;beg&mdash;your&mdash;pardon&mdash;sir,&rdquo; repeated the elderly
      person. He spoke in a confidential murmur. &ldquo;I thought you would like to
      know, sir&mdash;Lord Julius has come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked at him, silently revolving the intelligence, a
      puzzled frown between his pale brows. A furtive something in the butler&rsquo;s
      composed expression struck him. &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; he demanded, angrily. &ldquo;What
      are you whispering for? He&rsquo;s old enough to take care of himself, isn&rsquo;t
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler thrust out his dry underlip a trifle. &ldquo;I thought you would like
      to know, sir,&rdquo; he reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re wrong. I don&rsquo;t like to know!&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s tone&mdash;an
      indefinable, lurking suggestiveness in his face and eyes and voice&mdash;vexed
      Mr. Edward exceedingly. It annoyed him still more to note that his
      companions had tacitly turned their backs, and were affecting great
      preoccupation in something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept a wrathful eye on Barlow, as the latter bowed, turned, moved to
      the door and opened it. Of course, a man musn&rsquo;t slang servants, his
      irritated thought ran, but the covert impertinence in this old menial&rsquo;s
      manner was something no longer to be borne. The impulse to call the
      elderly fool back and send him packing on the instant, tingled hotly in
      the young man&rsquo;s blood. He even opened his lips to speak, but reflection
      checked his tongue. It would be bad form, for one thing; for another,
      perhaps he was not quite in the position to dismiss his grandfather&rsquo;s
      servants. He would speak to Welldon, the estate steward, instead&mdash;a
      sensible and civil man, by the way, who seemed to know which side his
      bread was buttered on. At the merest hint from the heir, Welldon would
      give Barlow the sack, and that would teach the rest a lesson. But all this
      would keep until Lord Julius had gone. Being an aged duffer himself, he
      would probably side with Barlow&mdash;and there was no point in offending
      Lord Julius. Very much to the contrary, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Edward&rsquo;s meditations, unwontedly facile in their movements for him,
      had reached this point, when his mind reverted to the fact that he was
      still regarding the back of Barlow, who, instead of going out, stood
      holding the door open, his lean figure poised in ceremonious expectancy.
      Even as the surprised Edward continued looking, the butler made a staid
      obeisance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stalwart, erect, burly old gentleman came in, and halted just over the
      threshold to look about him. He had the carriage, dress and general aspect
      of a prosperous and opinionated farmer. The suggestion of acres and crops
      was peculiarly marked in the broad, low soft hat on his head, and in the
      great white beard which spread fan-wise over his ample breast. He had the
      face of one who had spent a life in commanding others, and had learned
      meanwhile to master himself&mdash;a frank, high-featured, ruddy face, with
      a conspicuously prominent and well-curved nose, and steady, confident
      eyes. He folded his hands over his stick and, holding his head well back,
      glanced about the room at his ease. It was a glance from which the various
      eyes that it encountered somehow turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How-do, Eddy? How-do, Gus?&rdquo; the newcomer said impassively to the two
      young men who, with palpable constraint, came up to greet him. He shook
      hands with each, but seemed more interested in viewing the company at
      large. His appearance had produced a visible effect of numbness upon the
      group of guests, but he seemed not to mind this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a party!&rdquo; he observed. His voice was full and robust, and not
      unamiable. &ldquo;All military?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edward nodded. &ldquo;All but Gus, here. Glad to introduce &rsquo;em, if you
      like,&rdquo; he murmured, with a kind of sullen deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently, presently,&rdquo; said Lord Julius, with an effect of heartiness at
      which Edward lifted his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive over from Clune this morning?&rdquo; the young man asked. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll
      want breakfast. Ring the bell, Gus. We&rsquo;re just starting for the Mere
      copse. Glad to have you make an eighth gun, if you&rsquo;ll come to us after
      you&rsquo;ve eaten. You still shoot, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I still shoot,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward had a sense of embarrassment at his great-uncle&rsquo;s immobility in the
      doorway. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll get along to the gun-room now,&rdquo; he said to the
      others. Then to Lord Julius he remarked with an air of making
      conversation, &ldquo;I always say to the fellows that I ask nothing better in
      this world than to be as fit as you are when I&rsquo;m your age. Let&rsquo;s see,
      seventy-six, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elder man nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s a modest enough ambition,&rdquo; he
      observed. His steady gray eyes dallied with the young man&rsquo;s countenance
      for a moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m relieved to learn that you want nothing more than
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edward looked up swiftly, and braved an instant&rsquo;s piercing scrutiny of the
      other&rsquo;s face. Then he laughed, uneasily. &ldquo;Oh, I want a few other things,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Julius lowered his voice. &ldquo;I would put among your wants a trifling
      matter of good taste, Eddy,&rdquo; he said, not unkindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Edward flushed. &ldquo;If I could see that it really made any difference
      between the First and the Second,&rdquo; he answered with dogged civility, &ldquo;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t shoot until tomorrow. If you&rsquo;re keen about it now, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn your First and Second,&rdquo; broke in the old man, keeping his voice
      down below the hearing of the others, but letting impatience glow in his
      eyes; &ldquo;you had no business bringing these men here at all. No&mdash;I see
      that you don&rsquo;t understand me. You needn&rsquo;t explain. It&rsquo;s entirely a
      question of feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you take that view of it, sir,&rdquo; said Edward, gloomily. &ldquo;You
      know that I&rsquo;m willing enough to meet your views&mdash;if only&mdash;if
      only because I&rsquo;m going to need your help.&rdquo; Lord Julius gave a snort of
      contemptuous laughter, and nodded to himself with lifted brows. &ldquo;Really
      something in the way of consideration is due to such frankness as that,&rdquo;
       he said, with a pretense of reverie. &ldquo;Send your friends out of the room,
      Eddy,&rdquo; he went on, more gently&mdash;&ldquo;make what excuse you like&mdash;or
      take them out and come back to me&mdash;that&rsquo;s better. I did intend to
      have no secrets from them, but I&rsquo;ve relented. And yes&mdash;by the way&mdash;instead
      of coming here&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find me in the small morning room I will
      breakfast there. You&rsquo;ve filled this room with smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you&mdash;would you mind my bringing Gus?&rdquo; Edward asked,
      doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other thought for an instant. &ldquo;Oh, yes, Gus may come,&rdquo; he said, and
      with that left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rum old beggar, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Augustine to the company, with the sense
      that something had to be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad! he seemed to think he was in a synagogue!&rdquo; laughed Captain
      Burlington. &ldquo;Kept his hat on, you know,&rdquo; he explained in the next breath
      to the surprised and attentive faces about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t a Jew,&rdquo; said one of the others with gravity. &ldquo;He married
      one, but that doesn&rsquo;t make him one, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a joke! Can&rsquo;t you see a joke?&rdquo; protested Burlington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think much of it,&rdquo; growled Edward, sourly. &ldquo;Come along to
      the gunroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked Mr. Augustine, in an anxious murmur, a few minutes
      later, as the two brothers walked along the wide central hallway toward
      the appointed place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t think for the life of me,&rdquo; replied Edward. &ldquo;Unless Craven babbled
      about the baccarat when he got up to town. He&rsquo;s rather that sort, you
      know. He kicked about the stakes at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;after he&rsquo;d been hit,&rdquo; said Augustine. &ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s only that,
      you&rsquo;ll be an ass to let the old man rot you about it. Just stand up to
      him, and let him see you feel your position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; rejoined Edward, dubiously, &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s the position
      without money? If anybody could have foreseen what was going to happen&mdash;damn
      it all, I could have married as much as I needed. But as it is, I&rsquo;ve got
      Cora on my back, and the kid, and&mdash;my God! fancy doing the duke on
      four thou, a year net! Welldon tells me it can&rsquo;t be screwed a bit above
      that. Well, then, how can I afford to cheek Julius? When you come to that
      he isn&rsquo;t half a bad sort, you know. He stood my marriage awfully well.
      Gad, you know, we couldn&rsquo;t have lived if he hadn&rsquo;t drawn a check.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope he&rsquo;ll draw another,&rdquo; said Augustine. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough to be a
      pauper duke, but it&rsquo;s a bailey sight worse to be his brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rot!&rdquo; said Edward. &ldquo;My kid&rsquo;s a girl, and you&rsquo;re free to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had come to the door of the morning room. It stood ajar, and Edward
      pushed it open. Before the fireplace was visible the expected bulk and
      vast beard of Lord Julius, but the eyes of the brothers intuitively
      wandered to the window beyond, against which was outlined the figure of a
      much smaller man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secretary,&rdquo; whispered the quicker-minded Augustine out of the corner of
      his mouth as they advanced. The thought brought them a tempered kind of
      comfort. The same instinct which had prompted Edward to crave his
      brother&rsquo;s support led them both to welcome the presence of a fourth party.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked again toward the stranger, and Lord Julius, as he caught their
      returning glance, smiled and nodded significantly. &ldquo;Come here, Christian!&rdquo;
       he said, and the brothers saw now that it was a slender young man with a
      dark, fine face and foreign-looking eyes who moved toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Julius put a hand on the young man&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Christian,&rdquo; he said,
      and gave his full voice a new note of gravity, &ldquo;these are your two
      cousins, Mr. Edward Torr, a captain in the Hussars until recently, and Mr.
      Augustine Torr, a member of Parliament. Your coming will make some
      difference in their affairs, but I know that you will be good to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brothers had shaken hands with the new-comer automatically, while
      their minds were in the first stage of wonderment as to what the words
      being spoken about him meant. Now that silence fell, they stared slowly at
      him, at their great-uncle, at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;cousin?&rdquo; Edward managed to ask. He spoke as if his tongue
      filled his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The son of your uncle, Lord Ambrose Torr,&rdquo; the old man made quiet,
      carefully distinct answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another period of silence ensued, until Christian turned abruptly. &ldquo;It is
      very painful to me,&rdquo; he said hurriedly to the old man, and walked to the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is painful to everybody,&rdquo; said Lord Julius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so damned particularly painful to you, sir, I should say,&rdquo; put in
      Edward, looking his great-uncle in the face. The young man had slowly
      pulled himself together, and one could see the muscles of his neck being
      stiffened to keep his chin well in the air. His blue eyes had the effect
      of summoning all their resources of pride to gaze with dignity into the
      muzzle of a machine-gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustine was less secure in the control of his nerves. He stood a little
      behind his brother, and the elbow which he braced against him for support
      trembled. His eyes wandered about the room, and he moistened his lips with
      his tongue several times before he contrived to whisper something into
      Edward&rsquo;s ear. The latter received the suggestion, whatever it was, with an
      impatient shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scarcely do me justice,&rdquo; said Lord Julius, quietly, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s not
      worth mentioning at the moment. I must say you are taking it very well&mdash;much
      better than I expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edward squared his shoulders still more. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that we&rsquo;re takin&rsquo;
      it at all,&rdquo; he replied, with studied deliberation. &ldquo;You offer it, d&rsquo;ye see&mdash;but
      it doesn&rsquo;t follow that we take it. You come and bring this young fellow&mdash;this
      young gentleman, and you tell me that he is Ambrose&rsquo;s son. What good is
      that to me? Maybe he is, maybe he isn&rsquo;t. Ambrose may have had twenty sons,
      for all I know. I should be sorry to be one of them&mdash;but they&rsquo;re not
      to blame for that. I don&rsquo;t mind being civil to them&mdash;if they come to
      me in the right spirit&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped abruptly, and listened with a
      frown to more whispering from Augustine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to understand, Eddy&mdash;&rdquo; began Lord Julius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, perfectly!&rdquo; broke in the young man. &ldquo;I had an uncle who had to leave
      England before I was born. His name couldn&rsquo;t even be mentioned in the
      family&mdash;but I know all about him. God knows I&rsquo;ve had him flung in my
      face often enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us go into that,&rdquo; urged Lord Julius, softly, and with a
      sidelong nod toward the window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s needless cruelty to other people&mdash;and
      surely we can discuss this like gentlemen. You are really behaving
      splendidly, Eddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God! he thought we were cads!&rdquo; cried Edward, in husky indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;no,&rdquo; murmured the older man, soothingly. &ldquo;I
      only want you to grasp the thing as it is. You know me. You do not regard
      me as a foolish person who goes off half-cock. Well, I tell you that
      Christian here is the son of my nephew Ambrose, born in lawful wedlock,
      and that there is not a shadow of doubt about it. The proofs are all open
      to your inspection; there is not a flaw in them. And so I say to you, in
      all kindness&mdash;take it calmly and sensibly and like a gentleman. It is
      to your own interest to do so, as well. If you think, you will see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been telling him,&rdquo; said Augustine, strenuously, from
      behind his brother&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint smile fluttered about the old man&rsquo;s eyelids. &ldquo;It was the advice of
      a born statesman,&rdquo; he said, dryly. &ldquo;You are the political hope of the
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stiffening had melted from Edward&rsquo;s neck and shoulders. He turned
      irresolutely now, and looked at the floor. &ldquo;Of course I admit nothing; I
      reserve all my rights, till my lawyers have satisfied themselves,&rdquo; he said
      in a worn, depressed mutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, naturally,&rdquo; responded Lord Julius, with relieved cordiality. &ldquo;And
      now please me&mdash;do it all handsomely to the end&mdash;come and shake
      hands again with Christian, both of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brothers stood for a hesitating instant, then turned toward the window
      and began a movement of reluctant assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the surprise of all three, Christian forestalled their approach by
      wrenching open one half of the tall window, and putting a foot over the
      sill to the lawn outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will excuse me,&rdquo; he said, in his nervous, high voice, &ldquo;I am taking
      a little walk.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>pon the garden
      side of Caermere is a very large conservatory, built nearly fifty years
      ago, at the close of the life of the last duchess. The poor lady left no
      other mark of her meek existence upon the buildings, and it was thought at
      the time that she would never have ventured upon even this, had it not
      been that every one was mad for the moment about the wonderful palace of
      glass reared in London for the First Exhibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      In area and height, and in the spacious pretensions of its dome, the
      structure still suggests irresistibly the period of its inception. It is
      as ambitious as it is self-conscious; its shining respectability remains
      superior to all the wiles of climbers and creeping vines. The older
      servants cherish traditions of &ldquo;Her Grace&rsquo;s glass,&rdquo; as it used to be
      called. She had the work begun on her fortieth birthday, and precisely a
      year later it happened that she was wheeled in from the big morning room,
      and left at her own desire to recline in solitude under the palms beneath
      the dome, and that when they went to her at last she was dead. The
      circumstance that Shakespeare is supposed also to have died on the
      anniversary of his birth, has somehow come to be an integral part of the
      story, as it is kept alive now in the humbler parts of the Caermere
      household, but the duchess had nothing else in common with the poet. The
      very face of her, in her maturer years, is but dimly remembered. The
      portrait in the library is of a young Lady Clarissa, with pale ringlets
      and a childishly sweet countenance, and clad in the formal quaintness of
      the last year of King George the Fourth. She became the duchess, but in
      turn the duchess, seemed to become somebody else. That was the way with
      the brides brought home to Caermere. The pictures in the library show them
      all girlish, and innocently pretty, and for the most part fair-haired.
      Happily there is no painted record of what they were like when, still in
      middle life, they bade a last goodbye to the dark-skinned, big-shouldered
      sons they had borne, and perhaps made a little moan that no daughters were
      ever given to mothers at Caermere, and turned their sad faces to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crystal house had memories of another and more recent mistress, the
      countess. She had come six years after the other went, she had lived for
      twelve years&mdash;a silent, colorless, gently unhappy life&mdash;and then
      had faded away out of sight. It was this Lady Porlock who had caused the
      orchid houses to be built at the inner side of the conservatory, and it
      was in her time, too, that the gifted Cheltnam was fetched from her own
      father&rsquo;s house in Berkshire to be head gardener at Caermere. Her fame is
      indeed irrevocably linked with his, for the tea-rose of his breeding,
      bearing her maiden-name of the Hon. Florence Denson, is scarcely less well
      known than this hybrid sweet-briar the Countess of Porlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, in the third generation, still another lady had for some years
      enjoyed special property rights in this great glass apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage came into the conservatory from the large morning room, with
      a large volume in her hand, and an irresolute look on her face. She
      glanced about at the several couches piled with cushions and furs, at an
      easy-chair beyond&mdash;and yawned slightly. Then she wandered over to a
      row of early chrysanthemums, and, putting the book under her arm, occupied
      herself with the destruction of a few tiny beginnings of buds in the lower
      foliage. In this she employed as pincers the delicately tinted nails of a
      very shapely finger and thumb, and at the sign of some slight
      discoloration of these she stopped the work. From a glance at the nails,
      she went to a musing scrutiny of this whole right hand of hers, holding it
      up, and turning it from one composition of graceful curves to another. It
      had been called the most beautiful hand in England, but this morning its
      owner, upon a brief and rather listless inspection of its charms, yawned
      again. Finally she seated herself in the chair and, after a languid search
      for the place in her book, began to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half reclining thus, with the equable and shadowless light of the glass
      house about her, the young widow made a picture curiously different from
      any in the library within. All the dead and gone brides of the Torrs had
      been painted in bright attire; Lady Cressage wore a belted gown of black
      cloth, unrelieved save by a softened line of white at the throat and
      wrists. The others, without exception, had signified by elaborate
      hair-dressing not less than by dutifully vacuous facial expressions, their
      comprehension of the requirements of the place they had been called upon
      to fill; Lady Cressage&rsquo;s bistre hair was gathered in careless fashion to a
      loose knot at the back of the head, and in her exquisitely modeled face
      there was no hint whatever of docility or awed submission to any external
      claims. The profile of this countenance, outlined for the moment against a
      cluster of vividly purple pleroma blossoms, had the delicacy of a rare
      flower, but it conveyed also the impression of resolute and enduring
      force. If the dome above could have generated voices of its own, these
      would have murmured to one another that here at last was a woman whom
      Caermere could not break or even easily bend.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the season of 1892, London had heard a good deal of this lady. She was
      unknown before, and of her belongings people to this day knew and cared
      very little. There was a General Kervick enumerated in the retired list,
      who had vegetated into promotion in some obscure corner of India, and now
      led an equally inconspicuous existence somewhere in the suburbs&mdash;or
      was it in West Kensington? He had never belonged to a service club, but an
      occasional man encountered him once in a while at the Oriental, where he
      was supposed by the waiters to have an exceptional knowledge of peppers
      and chutneys. The name of his wife had been vaguely associated with
      charitable committees, or subscription committees, and here and there some
      one remembered having heard that she was distantly related to somebody.
      The elder Kervicks never secured a much more definite place in London&rsquo;s
      regard&mdash;even after this remarkable daughter had risen like a planet
      to dim the fixed stars of the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      The credit for having discovered and launched Miss Kervick came generally
      to be ascribed to Lady Selton, but perhaps this turned upon the fact that
      she lent her house in Park Lane for the culminating scene in the
      spectacular triumph of that young person. No doubt there were others who
      would have placed still bigger houses at the disposal of a bride whose
      wedding was, in many respects, the most interesting of the year, and some
      of these may have had as good a claim to the privilege as Lady Selton. As
      matters turned out, however, they were given no cause to repine. The
      marriage was not a success, and within one short year Lady Selton herself
      had grown a little shy about assuming responsibility for it. A year later
      she was quite prepared to repudiate all share in it, and after that people
      ceased to remember about it all, until the shock of the tragedy came to
      stir polite London into startled whisperings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly within the memory of living folk had a family been dealt such a
      swift succession of deadly blows as these which were rained upon the Torrs
      in the first half of 1896.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Porlock had been the heir of dukedom since most people could
      remember, and had got himself called to the House of Lords in his own
      right, apparently as a kind of protest against his father&rsquo;s unconscionable
      longevity, at least a dozen years before his own end came. It was not to
      be supposed that he desired a peerage for any other reason, since he had
      never chosen to seek a seat in the House of Commons, and indeed, save upon
      one occasion connected with ground game, made no use whatever of his
      legislative powers after they had been given to him. He cared nothing for
      politics, and read scarcely more in newspapers than in books. Up to middle
      life, he had displayed a certain tendency toward interest in fat stock and
      a limited number of allied agricultural topics, but the decline in farming
      values had turned him from this. In his earlier years, too, he had enjoyed
      being identified with the sporting set of his class in London, and about
      the racing circuit, but this association he also dropped out of as he grew
      older, partly because late nights bored him, partly because he could no
      longer afford to jeopardize any portion of his income. He came at last to
      think of his mastership of hounds as his principal tie to existence on
      land. He liked it all, from the sailing sweep over the highest barrier in
      an exceptionally rough country, to the smell of the kennels of an early
      morning across the frozen yards. This life with the horses and dogs, and
      with the people who belonged to the horses and dogs, offered fewer
      temptations to the evil temper in his blood than any other, and with
      growing years his dislike for the wear and tear of getting angry had
      become a controlling instinct. He continued to use bad language with an
      appropriate show of fervency, when occasion required, but he had got out
      of the way of scalding himself with rage inside. He even achieved a grim
      sort of jocularity toward the close. In the last year of his life a
      tenant-farmer, speaking to a toast, affirmed of him that &ldquo;a truer
      sportsman, nor yet a more humorous and affable nobleman, has never taken
      the chair at a puppy-walk luncheon within my recollection,&rdquo; and this
      tribute to his geniality both pleased and impressed the earl. He was then
      in his sixty-second year, and he might have lived into a mellowed, and
      even jovial old age, under the influence of this praise, had there been no
      unwritten law ending the hunting season in the early spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl cared very little for otters and rats, and almost nothing at all
      for salmon, so that when April came he usually went to his yacht, and
      practically lived aboard it until November. Sometimes he made long cruises
      in this substantial and comfortable vessel, which he delighted in
      navigating himself. He was lying in at Bremerhaven, for example, in May,
      when one of a sheaf of telegrams scattered along the line of North Sea
      ports in search of him, brought the news that his youngest son Joseph, who
      had drifted into Mashonaland after the collapse of the Jameson adventure,
      had been killed in the native rebellion. Upon consideration, the earl
      could not see that a post-haste return to England would serve any useful
      end. He sailed westward, however, after some telegraphic communication
      with England, and made his leisurely way down the Channel and round
      Cornwall to Milford Haven, where his wont was to winter his yacht, and
      where most of his crew were at home. The fact that he and the vessel were
      well known in this port rendered it possible to follow in detail
      subsequent events.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the 10th of June that Lord Porlock came to anchor in Milford,
      and went ashore, taking the afternoon train for Shrewsbury. He returned on
      the 14th, accompanied by his eldest son and heir, Lord Cressage. This
      latter personage was known only from hearsay at Milford, and local
      observation of him was therefore stimulated by a virgin curiosity. It was
      noted that Viscount Cressage&mdash;a stalwart and rubicund young man of
      more than his father&rsquo;s height, but somewhat less swarthy of aspect&mdash;was
      laboring under very marked depression. He hung about the hotel, during the
      delay incident upon cleaning up the yacht, taking on new stores and
      altering some of the sailing gear, in a plainly moping mood, saying little
      to his father and never a word to any one else. A number of witnesses were
      able to make it clear that at first he did not intend to sail forth, but
      was merely bearing his father company while the latter remained in harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact of their recent bereavement accounted in a general way for their
      reticence with each other, but it was impossible not to see that the
      younger man had something besides the death of a brother on his mind.
      When, on the second day of their waiting, the tide began to fill in which
      on its turn was to bear out the yacht, his nervous preoccupation grew
      painfully manifest. He walked across many times to the headland; he
      fidgeted in and out of the bar, taking drinks for which he obviously had
      no relish, and looking over and over again in the railway time-tables for
      information which he seemed incapable of fixing in his memory. At last,
      when everything was ready, and the earl stood with his hand out to say
      good-bye to his son, the latter had suddenly, and upon the evident impulse
      of the moment, declared with some excitement that he also would go. People
      remembered that he had said, as if in defensive explanation of his hasty
      resolve: &ldquo;Perhaps that will teach her a lesson!&rdquo; His father had only
      remarked &ldquo;Rot!&rdquo;&mdash;and with that the yacht sailed off, a heaving white
      patch against the blackening west.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what followed was too grossly unreasoning to afford a lesson to
      anybody. The morning newspapers of the 18th contained in one column
      confirmation of the earlier report that the Hon. Anselm Torr, second son
      of the earl of Porlock, had been a passenger on the ill-fated &ldquo;Drummond
      Castle,&rdquo; and had gone down with the rest in the night off Ushant; and in
      another column a telegram from Porthstinian, announcing the total loss of
      a large yacht, on the rocks known as the Bishop and Clerks, with all on
      board. The evening papers followed with the rumor that the lost yacht was
      the &ldquo;Minstrel,&rdquo; with both Lord Porlock and his son, Lord Cressage, on
      board; but it was not until the next afternoon that the public possessed
      all the facts in this extraordinary affair. Then it happened that the edge
      was rather taken off the horror of the tragic coincidence, by the
      announcement that these sudden deaths brought forward as next heir to the
      dukedom Captain Edward Torr, late of the &mdash;th Hussars, who was better
      known, perhaps, as the husband of Miss Cora Bayard. The thought of Cora as
      a prospective duchess made such a direct appeal to the gayer side of the
      popular mind, that the gruesome terrors surrounding her advancement were
      lost to sight. When, a few days later, it was stated that the venerable
      Duke of Glastonbury had suffered a stroke of paralysis, and lay at
      Caermere in a critical state, the news only made more vivid the picture of
      the music-hall dancer turned into Her Grace which the public had in its
      mind&rsquo;s eye. Her radiant portrait in the photographic weeklies and budgets
      was what remained uppermost in the general memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time, however, in that little fraction of the public which is called
      Society, the figure of another woman concentrated interest upon itself, in
      connection with the Torr tragedy. The fact that a music-hall person was to
      wear a great title had no permanent hold upon the imagination of this
      class. They would probably see rather less of her then than now&mdash;and
      the thing had no longer the charm of the unusual. But they had known Lady
      Cressage. They had admired her, followed after her, done all sorts of nice
      things for her, in that season of her wonderful triumph as the most
      beautiful girl, and the most envied bride, in London. After her marriage
      she had been very little in evidence, it was true; one hardly knew of any
      other reigning beauty who had let the sceptre slip through her fingers so
      promptly and completely. What was the secret of it all? It could not be
      said that she had lost her good looks, or that she was lacking in
      cleverness. There was no tangible scandal against her; to the contrary,
      she seemed rather surprisingly indifferent to men&rsquo;s company. Of course, it
      was understood that her marriage was unhappy, but that was scarcely a
      reason for allowing herself to be so wholly snuffed out of social
      importance. Everybody knew what the Torrs were like as husbands, and
      everybody would have been glad to be good to her. But in some
      unaccountable way, without quite producing the effect of rebuffing
      kindness, she had contrived to lapse from the place prepared for her. And
      now those last words from the lips of poor young Cressage&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps
      that will teach her a lesson!&rdquo;&mdash;sifted their way from the coroner&rsquo;s
      inquest in a Welsh village up to London, and set people thinking once
      more. Who could tell? It might be that the fault was not all on one side.
      According to the accounts of Milford, he was in a state of visible
      excitement and mental distress. The very fact of his going off alone in a
      yacht with his father, of whom he notoriously saw as little as possible on
      dry land, showed that he must have been greatly upset. And his words could
      mean nothing save that it was a quarrel with his wife which had sent him
      off to what proved to be his death. What was this quarrel about? And was
      it the woman, after all, who was to blame? Echoes of these questions, and
      of their speculative and varied answers, kept themselves alive here and
      there in London till Parliament rose in August. They were lost then in the
      general flutter toward the moors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage, meantime, had not quitted Caermere or disclosed any design
      of doing so, and it is there we return to her, where she sat at her ease
      under the palms in the glass-house, with a book open before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spattering reports of a number of guns, not very far away, caused her
      presently to lift her head, but after an instant, with a fleeting frown,
      she went back to her book. The racket continued, and finally she closed
      the volume, listened with a vexed face for a minute or two and then sprang
      to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively this is too bad!&rdquo; she declared aloud, to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unexpectedly, as she turned, she found confronting her another young
      woman, also clad in black, even to the point of long gloves, and a broad
      hat heavy with funereal plumes. In her hand she held some unopened
      letters, and on her round, smooth, pretty countenance there was a doubtful
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-mornin&rsquo;, dear,&rdquo; said this newcomer. Her voice, not unmusical in
      tone, carried the suggestion of being produced with sedulous regard to a
      system. &ldquo;There were no letters for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a momentary pause, and then Lady Cressage, as if upon
      deliberation, answered, &ldquo;Good-morning&mdash;Cora.&rdquo; She turned away
      listlessly as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, so it <i>is</i> one of my &lsquo;Cora&rsquo; days, after all,&rdquo; said the other,
      with a long breath of ostentatious reassurance. &ldquo;I never know in the least
      where to have you, my dear, you know&mdash;and particularly this mornin&rsquo;;
      I made sure you&rsquo;d blame me for the guns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blame&rdquo;&mdash;commented Lady Cressage, musingly&mdash;&ldquo;I no longer blame
      anybody for anything. I&rsquo;ve long since done with my fancy for playing at
      being God, and distributing judgments about among people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re quite right about this shootin&rsquo; the home covers,&rdquo; protested
      the other. &ldquo;I gave Eddy a fair bit of my mind about it&mdash;but you know
      what he is, when once he&rsquo;s headed in a given direction. You might as well
      talk soft to the east wind. And, for that matter, I was dead against his
      bringin&rsquo; these men down here at all&mdash;though it may surprise you to
      hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage, still looking away, shook her head very slightly. &ldquo;No&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t find myself particularly surprised,&rdquo; she said, with an effect of
      languor. &ldquo;Really, I can&rsquo;t be said to have given the matter a thought, one
      way or the other. It is neither my business nor my wish to form opinions
      about your husband&rsquo;s friends. We were speaking of something else, were we
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Edward; &ldquo;I mentioned that sometimes I&rsquo;m &lsquo;Cora,&rsquo;
      and sometimes it&rsquo;s very much the other way about. I merely mentioned it&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      think I mean to complain&mdash;only I began calling <i>you</i> Edith from
      the start&mdash;from the first day I came here, after the&mdash;after the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you did. It was very kind of you,&rdquo; murmured Edith, but with no
      affectation of gratitude in her voice. Then, slowly, she turned her eyes
      toward her companion, and added in a more considerate tone: &ldquo;But then you
      are by nature a much kindlier person than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you say that,&rdquo; put in the other, &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t true, you know.
      It&rsquo;s only that I&rsquo;ve seen more of the world, and am so much older than you
      are. That&rsquo;s what tells, my dear&mdash;it&rsquo;s years that smooths the temper
      down, and rubs off one&rsquo;s sharp corners&mdash;of course, if one has some
      sense to start with. I assure you, Edith, that when I was your age I was a
      perfect tiger-cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage smiled in a wan fashion, as if in despite of her mood. &ldquo;You
      always make such a point of your seniority,&rdquo; she said, not unamiably, &ldquo;but
      when I look at you, I can never believe you&rsquo;re of any age at all. I seem a
      thousand years old beside you.&rdquo; Mrs. Edward showed some dazzling teeth in
      her pleased appreciation of the compliment. Her smile was as
      characteristic as her voice, in its studiously regular and equable
      distribution. The even parting of her bright lips, with their symmetrical
      inner lines of white, was supported to a nicety of proportional value by
      eyelashes and eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been saying,&rdquo; she commented, with frank enjoyment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      good temper that does the trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To tell the truth, Mrs. Edward&rsquo;s was a face which bore no visible relation
      to years. It was of rounded oval in contour, with beautifully chiseled
      small features, a faultless skin which was neither fair nor dark and fine
      large eyes that seemed sometimes blue, and as often something else. In
      these eyes there lay always, within touch of the surface, a latent smile,
      ready to beam, to sparkle, to dance, to languish in mellow softness or
      glitter in cool abstract recognition of pleasantries afloat, all at the
      instant bidding of the lips below. These lips, delicately arched and of
      vivid warmth of color, were as restricted in their movements as is the
      mercury in a thermometer. They did not curl sidewise upon occasion; they
      never pouted, or pulled themselves inward together under the stress of
      sudden emotion. They did nothing but separate, in perfectly balanced
      measure, sometimes by only a hair&rsquo;s breadth, again in the freest fashion,
      but always in painstaking harmony with the spirit of the glance above.
      Students of this smile, or rather of this range of graded smiles,
      ordinarily reached the conclusion that it was the lips which gave the
      signal to the eyes. Certain it is that they worked together in trained
      accord, and that the rest of the face did nothing at all. The white
      forehead furrowed itself with no lines of puzzled thought; there was not
      the shadow of a wrinkle at the corners of the little mouth, or about the
      shapely brown lashes&mdash;and it seemed incredible that time should ever
      bring one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside this serene and lovely mask&mdash;in the placidity of which one
      found the pledge of an easy temper along with the promise of unfailing
      youth&mdash;the face of Lady Cressage was still beautiful, but in a
      restless and strenuous way. If she did produce the effect of being the
      older of the two, it was because Mrs. Edward&rsquo;s countenance had nothing to
      do with any such standard of comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you come to think of it,&rdquo; the latter went on now, &ldquo;you <i>do</i>
      seem older than I do, dear&mdash;I mean you seem so to me. Of course I
      know there&rsquo;s a good six years&rsquo; difference between us&mdash;and as far as
      appearance goes, I needn&rsquo;t say that you&rsquo;d be the belle of the ball in
      London as easily as you were four years ago&mdash;but all the same you
      have the knack of making me feel as if I were the youngster, and you the
      grown-up. I&rsquo;ve a sister&mdash;five years younger than me&mdash;and she
      does the same thing. When she looks at me&mdash;just quietly turns her
      eyes full on me, you know&mdash;it seems as if I ought to have a pinafore
      on, and she have spectacles and a cap. Oh, she used to give me the jumps,
      that girl did. We haven&rsquo;t seen much of each other, these last few years;
      we didn&rsquo;t hit it off particularly well&mdash;but&mdash;why, hello! this <i>is</i>
      odd, if you like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the other, perfunctorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Edward had been, shuffling the envelopes in her hand the while she
      spoke, and idly noting their superscriptions. She held up one of them now,
      in explanation of her remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, talk of the devil, you know&mdash;I was speaking of my sister
      Frank, and here&rsquo;s a letter from her. She hasn&rsquo;t written a line to me in&mdash;how
      long is it?&mdash;why, it must be&mdash;well, certainly not since I was
      married. Funny, isn&rsquo;t it? I wonder if it&rsquo;s anything about the pater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She continued to regard the sealed missive absent-mindedly, as if the
      resource of opening it had not yet suggested itself to her. In the
      meantime, something else occurred to her, and she turned to face Lady
      Cressage, who had seated herself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant what I said about these men Eddy&rsquo;s brought down,&rdquo; she declared.
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want them to be asked, and I don&rsquo;t like their being here, any
      more than you do. Yes, I want to have you understand,&rdquo; she persisted, as
      the other offered a gesture of deprecation, &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m the last person in
      the world to round on old pals, but really, as I told Eddy, a man in his
      position must draw the line somewhere. I don&rsquo;t mind giving a leg-up to old
      Pirie&mdash;in a quiet way, of course&mdash;for he&rsquo;s not half a bad sort
      by himself; but as for the rest, what are they? I don&rsquo;t care for their
      families or their commissions&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen too much of the world to be
      taken in by kid of that sort&mdash;I say they&rsquo;re bounders. I never was
      what you might call keen about them as the right friends for Eddy, even
      before&mdash;I mean in the old days, when it didn&rsquo;t matter so much what
      company he kept. But now, with everything so altered, he ought to see that
      they&rsquo;re not in his class at all. And that&rsquo;s just what I can&rsquo;t get him to
      do in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men have their own views in these matters. They are often rather
      difficult to understand,&rdquo; commented Edith, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so!&rdquo; began Mrs. Edward. &ldquo;Why, if I were a man, and in
      Eddy&rsquo;s place&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her words had ended aimlessly, as her eyes followed the lines of the
      letter she had at last opened and begun to read. She finished the brief
      task, and then, going back to the top of the single page, went over it
      again more attentively. There was something indefinably impressive about
      the silence in which she did this, and Lady Cressage presently raised an
      inquiring glance. Mrs. Edward&rsquo;s face exhibited no marked change of
      expression, but it had turned deathly pale. The unabated redness of the
      lips gave this pallor a ghastliness which frightened Edith, and brought
      her to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the name&mdash;&rdquo; she began, but the other held up a black-gloved
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this something you know about?&mdash;something you&rsquo;ve been putting
      up?&rdquo; Cora demanded, in a harsh, ungoverned voice, moving forward as she
      spoke. &ldquo;Look at this. Here&rsquo;s what my sister writes.&rdquo; She did not offer to
      show the letter, but huskily read forth its contents:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;London, September 30.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My dear Cora: I don&rsquo;t know whether you will thank me or not, but I feel
      that some one ought to warn you, if only that you may pull yourself
      together to meet what is coming. Your house is built of cards, and it is
      only a question of days, perhaps of hours, when it will be pushed over.
      Your husband is not the heir, after all. I am truly in great grief at the
      thought of what this will mean to you, and I can only hope that you will
      believe me when I sign myself,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Your sincerely affectionate sister,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Frances.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two women exchanged a tense look in which sheer astonishment
      encountered terror, and mingled with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know nothing of this,&rdquo; faltered Edith, more in response to the
      other&rsquo;s wild eyes than to the half-forgotten inquiries that had prefaced
      the reading of the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No trick of a child, eh? What do they call it, posthumous?&rdquo; Cora panted,
      still with the rough voice which had shaken off the yoke of tuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith lifted her head. &ldquo;That is absurd,&rdquo; she answered, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they confronted each other thus, a moving shadow outside caught their
      notice. Instinctively turning their eyes, they beheld through the glass a
      stranger, a slender young man with a soft hat of foreign fashion, striding
      across the lawn away from the house. He held his head high in the air, and
      they could see that the hands carried stiffly outstretched at his sides
      were clenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He struts across the turf as if he owned it,&rdquo; said Edith, clutching
      vaguely at the meaningless relief which this interruption seemed to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Edward had sunk info the chair, and buried her face in her
      black-gloved hands.
    </p>

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>hristian began his
      walk with swift, energetic steps, and a guiding eye fixed resolutely on a
      distinguishing mark in the distant line of tree-tops beyond, as if both
      speed and directness of course were of utmost urgency to his purpose.
      While his body moved forward thus automatically, however, his mind
      remained engrossed with what had been said and done in the room he was
      leaving behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brain reproduced over and over again the appearance of the two young
      brothers, their glances at each other, their sneering scowls at him. The
      picture of Augustine whispering in Edward&rsquo;s ear, and of Edward shaking his
      sulky head, stuck in his memory as a living thing. He had continued to see
      it after he had turned his back on them and gone to the window. The
      infamous words which had been spoken about his father were a part of this
      picture, and their inflection still rang in his ears just as the young men
      still stood before his eyes, compact of hostility to him and his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of guns in the wood he approached was for a time subordinated in
      his mind to those bitter echoes of Edward&rsquo;s speech. When at last these
      reports of firing attracted his attention, he had passed out of sight of
      Caermere, and found himself on a vaguely defined path at the end of a
      broad heath, much overgrown with heather and broom and low, straggling,
      inhospitable-looking shrubs novel to his eye. Curious movements among this
      shaggy verdure caught his wandering notice, and he stopped to observe them
      more closely. A great many rabbits&mdash;or would they be hares?&mdash;were
      making their frightened escape from the wood in front of him, and darting
      about for cover in this undergrowth. He became conscious now of an
      extraordinary tumult in the wood itself&mdash;a confused roar of men&rsquo;s
      voices raised in apparently meaningless cries, accompanied by an
      unintelligible pounding of sticks on timber and crackling brush. This
      racket almost drowned the noise of the remote firing; its effect of
      consternation upon the small inhabitants of the thicket was only less than
      the bewilderment that it caused in Christian&rsquo;s mind. Forgetting altogether
      his own concerns, he pushed cautiously forward to spy out the cause of the
      commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat later, he emerged from the wood again, having obtained a
      tolerable notion of what was going on. He had caught a view of one line of
      beaters making their way through a copse, diagonally away from him&mdash;rough
      men clad for the most part in white jackets, who shouted and thrashed
      about them with staves as they went&mdash;and it was easy enough to
      connect their work, and the consequent rise and whirring rush of birds
      before it, with the excited fusillade of guns farther on. Christian did
      not get a sight of the sportsmen themselves. Albeit with some doubts as to
      the dignity of the proceeding, he made a detour of the piece of woodland,
      with the idea of coming out upon the shooting party, but when he arrived
      at the barrier it was to find on the spot only a couple of men in greenish
      corduroys, whom he took to be underkeepers. They were at work before a
      large heap of pheasants, tying the birds in pairs by the necks, and
      hanging them over a long stick, stretched between two trees, which already
      bent under its burden. They glanced up from their employment at Christian,
      and when he stooped to pick up one of the cartridge cases with which the
      ground at his feet was strewn, they exchanged some muttered comment at
      which both laughed aloud. He instinctively threw the little tube down, and
      looked away from the men. The thought occurred to him that if they only
      knew who he was their confusion would be pathetic, but as it was, they had
      the monopoly of self-possession, and it was he who shyly withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole diversion, however, had cleared and sweetened his mood. He
      retraced his steps through the wood and then struck off in a new direction
      across the heath, at a more leisurely pace than he had come, his mind
      dwelling pleasurably upon the various picturesque phases of what he had
      witnessed. The stray glimpses of <i>la chasse</i> which had been afforded
      him in the South had had nothing in common with this. The unkempt freedom
      of the growths about him appealed to his senses as cultivated parks and
      ordered forests had never done. It was all so strong and simple and
      natural&mdash;and the memory of the beaters smashing along in the thicket,
      bawling and laying about them with their clubs, gave it a primitive note
      which greatly pleased his fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heath was even finer, in his eyes, than the wood. The air stirring
      across it, for one thing, had a quality which he seemed never to have
      known before&mdash;and the wild, almost savage, aspect of its squat gray
      and russet herbage, the sense of a splendidly unashamed idleness and
      unproductiveness suggested by its stretches of waste land, charmed his
      imagination. He said to himself, as he sauntered here, that he would
      gallop every day across this wonderful plain, with a company of big dogs
      at his horse&rsquo;s heels. The thought of the motion in the saddle inspired him
      to walk faster. He straightened himself, put his hands to his coat at the
      breast as he had seen young Englishmen do on their pedestrian tours, and
      strode briskly forward, humming to himself as he moved. The hateful
      episode of the morning had not so much faded from his thoughts, as shaken
      itself into a new kaleidoscopic formation. Contact with these noble
      realities out of doors had had the effect, as it were, of immeasurably
      increasing his stature. When he thought of those paltry cousins of his, it
      was as if he looked down upon their insignificance from a height.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came at last face to face with a high stone wall, the pretensions and
      obvious antiquity of which told him at once that he had returned to the
      vicinity of the castle. Sure enough, there were discernible at a
      considerable distance down to the right some of the turrets and roofs of
      Caermere, and he turned his course in that direction. It seemed to him a
      long way that he walked by the side of this great wall, marveling as he
      did so at its size and at the ambitious views of the persons who built it.
      The reflection that they were ancestors of his own came to his mind, and
      expanded therein. He also would build like a great nobleman in his time!
      What was there so grand as building?&mdash;he mused as he looked about him&mdash;unless
      it might be the heath and the brownish-purple hills beyond, and these also
      one intuitively thought of as having been built.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a small doorway appeared in the massive wall, and Christian,
      finding it unlocked, passed through it into a vast garden. The inner and
      sunny side of the wall, as far as he could see in either direction, was
      veined with the regularly espaliered branches of dwarf trees flattened
      against it, from which still depended here and there belated specimens of
      choice fruit. On the other side of the path following close this wall,
      down which he proceeded, were endless rows of small trees and staked
      clumps of canes, all now bereft of their season&rsquo;s produce. The spectacle
      did not fit with what had been mentioned to him of the poverty of
      Caermere. Farther on, a tall hedge stretching at right angles from the
      wall separated this orchard from what he saw now, by glimpses through an
      open arch, to a be a flower garden. He quickened his pace at the sight,
      for flowers were very near his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first there was not much to move his admiration. The sunlit profusion
      of his boyhood&rsquo;s home had given him standards of size and glowing color
      which were barely approached, and nowhere equaled, here. Suddenly he came
      upon something, however, before which he perforce stopped. It was the
      beginning of a long row of dahlias, rounded flowers on the one side of
      him, pointed and twisted cactus varieties on the other, and he had
      imagined nothing like this before in his life. Apparently no two of the
      tall plants, held upright to the height of his breast by thick stakes,
      were alike, and he knew not upon which to expend the greater delight, the
      beauty of their individual blossoms or the perfection of skill exhibited
      in the color-arrangement of the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved slowly along, examining the more notable flowers in detail with
      such ardor that a young lady in a black gown, but with a broad hat of
      light straw on her pale hair, advanced up the path, paused, and stood
      quite near him for some moments before he perceived her presence. Then
      with a little start, he took off his hat, and held it in his hands while
      he made a stiff bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fond of flowers?&rdquo; Lady Cressage said, more as a remark than an
      inquiry. She observed him meanwhile with politely calm interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These dahlias are extraordinary!&rdquo; he exclaimed, very earnestly. &ldquo;I have
      never seen such flowers, and such variety. It surprises me a great deal.
      It is a spécialité in England, n&rsquo;est ce pas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have heard that we have carried the dahlia further than other
      countries have done,&rdquo; responded the lady, courteously giving the name the
      broad-voweled sound he had used. She added with a pleasant softening of
      eyes and lips: &ldquo;But you ought not to begrudge us one little triumph like
      this&mdash;you who come from the very paradise of flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The implication in her words caused him to straighten himself, and to
      regard her with a surprised new scrutiny. He saw now that she was very
      beautiful, and he strove to recall the few casual remarks Lord Julius had
      dropped, concerning the two ladies at the castle, as a clue to her
      identity. One had been an actress, he remembered&mdash;and this lady&rsquo;s
      graceful equanimity had, perhaps, something histrionic in it. But if she
      happened not to be the actress, then it would no doubt anger her very much
      to be taken for one. He knew so little of women&mdash;and then his own
      part in the small drama occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is evident that you understand who I am,&rdquo; he said, with another bow.
      The further thought that in either case she was related to him, was a part
      of the family of which he would soon be the head, came to give him fresh
      confidence. &ldquo;It is not only dahlias that are carried to unrivaled heights
      of beauty in England,&rdquo; he added, and bowed once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled outright at this. &ldquo;That is somewhat too&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;continental
      for these latitudes,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Men don&rsquo;t say such glowing things in
      England. We haven&rsquo;t sun enough, you know, properly to ripen rose-hips&mdash;or
      compliments. I should like to introduce myself, if I may&mdash;I am Edith
      Cressage&mdash;and Lord Julius has told me the wonderful story about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand as she spoke, with a deliberate gesture, which
      afforded Christian time to note its exquisite modeling, if he had had the
      eyes for it. But he took the hand in his own rather cursorily, and began
      speaking with abruptness before he had finished his bow and relinquished
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is much too wonderful,&rdquo; he said, hastily. &ldquo;It frightens me. I cannot
      get used to it. I have the feeling that I should go away somewhere, and
      live by myself, till it became all familiar to me. But then I see it would
      be just as painful, wherever I went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let us hope it would be least painful here, of all places,&rdquo; urged the
      lady, in gentle deprecation of his tone. &ldquo;Caermere is not gay, but it can
      be soothing and restful&mdash;to those who stand in need of solace. It has
      come to be my second home&mdash;I never thought one could grow so deeply
      attached to a place. It has been to me like a tender old nurse and
      confidante&mdash;in times when&mdash;when its shelter and consolation were
      very welcome&rdquo;&mdash;she faltered for an instant, with averted face, then
      raised her moist eyes to his, and let them sparkle&mdash;&ldquo;and oh, you will
      grow to love Caermere with all your heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian felt himself much moved. He had put on his hat, and stepped now
      to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen nothing of it at all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am going to ask that you
      shall show it to me&mdash;you who love it so much. But if I shall remain
      here now, that I cannot in the least tell. Nothing is arranged, so far as
      I know. I am quite in Lord Julius&rsquo; hands&mdash;thus far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had tacitly begun to move down the path together, loitering to look
      at plants on either side which particularly invited notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Julius is a remarkable man,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If one is fortunate enough
      to enlist his friendship, there is no end to what he can do for him. You
      can hardly imagine what a difference it makes for you in everything&mdash;the
      fact that he is warmly disposed towards you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that I have been told,&rdquo; said Christian, &ldquo;and I see it for myself,
      too. I do not feel that I know him very well, as yet. It was only
      yesterday morning that I met him for the first time at an hotel in
      Brighton. We breakfasted together, we looked through papers together and
      then we began a long railway journey together, which only ended a few
      hours ago. We have talked a great deal in this time, but, as I have said,
      the man himself is not very clear to me yet. But no one could have been
      kinder&mdash;and I think he likes me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course he does,&rdquo; affirmed Lady Cressage, as if anything else would
      have been incredible. &ldquo;And&mdash;talking with him so much, so
      continuously, you no doubt understand the entire situation. I am glad that
      he at least left it to me to show you over Caermere; there is apparently
      nothing else in which I can be of use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian, though he smiled in kindly recognition of her attitude, offered
      no verbal comment, and after a wandering digression about dahlias, she
      returned to the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there <i>is</i> anything I can tell you&mdash;about the family, the
      position of affairs in general, and so on&mdash;you should not stand on
      ceremony with me. Has he, for example, explained about money affairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked keenly at her for an instant, as if the question took
      him by surprise. Then he answered frankly enough: &ldquo;Nothing definite. I
      only gather that it will be made easier for me than it would have been for&mdash;for
      other members of the family, if they&mdash;had been in my place. But
      perhaps that is not what I should say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage smiled on him reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t think of me in that light,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I stand quite outside
      the&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;the interested family circle. I have no
      ax of any description to grind. You, of course, have been told my position
      in the castle&mdash;that is, so far as it can be told by others. It is a
      simple enough story&mdash;I was to have been everything, and then the wind
      happens to change off the Welsh coast and lo! I am nothing&mdash;nothing!
      It is not even certain that I am not a beggar&mdash;living here on alms.
      Legally, everything is in such confusion that no one knows how he stands.
      But so far as I am concerned, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. My cup has been filled so
      full&mdash;so long:&mdash;that a little more or less trouble is of no
      importance. Oh, I assure you, I do not desire to be considered in the
      matter at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made this last declaration with great earnestness, in immediate
      response to the sympathetic look and gesture with which Christian had
      interrupted her narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      His gentle eyes regarded her troubled beauty with compassionate softness.
      &ldquo;I venture to think that you will be considered a good deal, none the
      less,&rdquo; he remarked, in a grave yet eager tone. The sense of elation at
      being able to play the part of Providence to such a lady spread through
      his mind and possessed his being. The lofty possibilities of the powers
      devolving upon him had never been so apparent before. He instinctively put
      out his arm toward her, in such overt fashion that she could but take it.
      She did not lean upon it, but imparted to the contact instead a kind of
      ceremonial reserve which directly ministered to the patrician side of his
      mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked, if possible, still more slowly now, pausing before almost
      every stake; their talk was of the flowers, with occasional lapses into
      the personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you said about Lord Julius,&rdquo; she remarked, in one of these
      interludes, &ldquo;is quite true. He has it in his power to say whether the duke
      shall be a rich man or a pauper, and until yesterday he was all for the
      pauper. If poor Porlock and his sons had lived, they knew very well that
      Lord Julius was no friend of theirs, and would starve the title whichever
      of them had it. And so with these others&mdash;Edward and Augustine&mdash;only
      with them, it isn&rsquo;t merely dislike but loathing that Lord Julius has for
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met those young gentlemen this morning,&rdquo; said Christian stiffly. &ldquo;It
      seemed to me that Lord Julius went quite out of his way to be kind with
      them. I should never have gathered that he hated them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not personally,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he dislikes anybody
      personally. But in what you may call their representative capacity he is
      furious with people if they don&rsquo;t measure up to his idea of what they
      should be. I never heard of any other family that had such a man in it. I
      used to admire him very much&mdash;when I was newly married&mdash;I
      thought his ideals for the family were so noble and fine&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t
      know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you have suspicions of Julius, then?&rdquo; asked Christian, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Nothing is farther from my thoughts. Only I
      have seen it all, here. I have lived in the very heart of it&mdash;and
      much as I sympathize with his feelings, I can&rsquo;t help feeling that he is
      unjust&mdash;not willfully, but still unjust. He and his son are men of
      great intelligence and refined tastes; they would do honor to any
      position. But is it quite fair of them to be so hard on cousins of theirs
      who were not given great intelligence, and who had no capacity whatever
      for refinement? That is what I mean. You saw those young men this morning.
      They are not up to much, certainly; their uncle Porlock and his sons
      averaged, perhaps, even a shade lower&mdash;you see I am speaking quite
      frankly&mdash;but when it is all said and done, they were not so
      remarkably worse than other men of their class. If any of the six had
      succeeded to the title, he would not have been such a startling anomaly in
      the peerage. I doubt if he would have attracted attention, one way or the
      other. But it became a fixed idea with Lord Julius years ago to get
      control of the estates, and to use this control to bully the elder line
      into the paths of sweetness and light. It didn&rsquo;t succeed in the least&mdash;and
      I think he grew a little spiteful. That is all. And besides&mdash;what
      does it matter? It is all ancient history now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian was looking straight before him, with a meditative gaze. They
      walked for some moments in silence before he spoke. &ldquo;And how did he know
      that he would like me?&rdquo; he demanded, musingly. &ldquo;How should he be confident
      that I was better than the others? Perhaps&mdash;do you know?&mdash;was he
      very fond of my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; she responded. It was impossible not to note the brevity
      of her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one speaks willingly of my father,&rdquo; he broke forth with impulsive
      bitterness. &ldquo;Even Lord Julius would tell me nothing of him. And the young
      lady on the boat&mdash;she too&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and his companion, who had been looking away, glanced again at
      him. &ldquo;The young lady on the boat,&rdquo; she said, more by way of suggesting to
      him a safe topic than as an inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I much want to know who she can be,&rdquo; he cried, unconsciously
      accepting the diversion. He described the meeting at Rouen, the
      conversation and, after a fashion of his own, the girl herself. &ldquo;She
      said,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that she had personally something to do with the story&mdash;&lsquo;remotely&rsquo;
      was the word she used. I asked Lord Julius, but he could not think who she
      might be. She earns her own living&mdash;she told me that&mdash;and she
      had never been out of England before. She is not well educated&mdash;in
      the school sense, I mean&mdash;her French was ridiculous. But she spoke
      very beautifully her own language, and her mind filled me with charm, but
      even more so her good heart. We swore friendship for all time&mdash;or at
      least I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Lady Cressage. Her thoughts had not been idle, and they
      brought to her now on the instant a satisfactory clue. She pondered it for
      a little, before she decided to speak. &ldquo;I think I know who this remarkable
      young lady must be,&rdquo; she observed then. &ldquo;This Captain Edward whom you met
      this morning&mdash;he has a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; put in Christian abruptly&mdash;&ldquo;the actress-lady; Julius
      told me of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose &lsquo;actress&rsquo; would cover the thing,&rdquo; she answered, with an air of
      amiable indifference. &ldquo;She danced more than she acted, I believe, but
      &lsquo;actress&rsquo; is a very general term. Well, your eternal friend is, I suspect,
      her younger sister. &lsquo;I have never seen her, but by accident I happen to
      know that she is aware of your coming to England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian&rsquo;s mobile face had lengthened somewhat. &ldquo;Is she also an&mdash;an
      &lsquo;actress&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked, dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage looked skyward, with halfclosed eyes, in an effort of
      memory. &ldquo;I really seem to have heard what she did,&rdquo; she mused,
      hesitatingly. &ldquo;I know her sister has often spoken of her. Is it &lsquo;barmaid&rsquo;?
      No. &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo;? No, it&rsquo;s her father who&rsquo;s in the General Post Office.
      Why, now, how stupid of me! She can&rsquo;t be a nurse, of course, or there
      would have been her uniform. Oh, now I remember&mdash;she&rsquo;s a typewriter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not clear to her whether Christian wholly comprehended the term,
      now that she had found it. She perceived, however, that he disliked
      something in what she had said, or in her manner of saying it. The
      remarkable responsiveness of his countenance to passing emotions and moods
      within him had already impressed her. She regarded his profile now with a
      sidelong glance, and reconstructed some of her notions about him by the
      help of what she saw. Nothing was said, until suddenly he paused, gazing
      with kindled eye upon the prospect opened before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come to the end of the garden, and stood at the summit of a broad
      stone-kerbed path descending in terraces. Above them, the dense foliage of
      the yews rising at either side of the gap in the hedge had been trained
      and cut into an arched canopy. From under this green gateway Christian
      looked down upon a Caermere he had not imagined to himself before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The castle revealed itself for the first time, as he beheld it now, in its
      character as a great medieval fortress. On his arrival in the morning,
      emerging from the shadowed driveway into the immediate precinct of the
      house, he had seen only its variously modernized parts; these, as they
      were viewed from this altitude, shrank to their proper proportions&mdash;an
      inconsiderable fraction of the mighty whole. All about, the massive
      shoulders of big hills shelved downward to form the basin-like hollow in
      which the castle seemed to stand, but their large bulk, so far from
      dwarfing Caermere, produced the effect of emphasizing its dimensions. Its
      dark-gray walls and towers, with their bulging clumps of chimneys and
      turrets, and lusterless facets of many-angled roofings, all of somber
      slate, were visibly the product, the very child, of the mountains. A
      sensation of grim, adamantine, implacable power took hold of the young
      man&rsquo;s brain as he gazed. For a long time he did not want to talk, and felt
      vaguely that he was signifying this by the slight, sustained pressure of
      his arm against hers. At all events, she grasped his wish, and preserved
      silence, holding herself a little behind him, so that he might look down,
      without distraction, upon his kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These Torrs,&rdquo; he burst forth all at once, with a nervous uncertainty in
      his tones as of one out of breath, &ldquo;these ancestors of mine&mdash;the
      family I belong to&mdash;did they produce great men? You must know their
      history. Julius says we are the most ancient family in England. I have not
      had the time yet to learn anything of what we did. Were there heroes and
      famous soldiers and learned scholars among us? To look at that wonderful
      castle there at our feet, it seems as if none but born chiefs and rulers
      of mankind could ever have come out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Edward and his brother Augustine were both born there,&rdquo; she
      permitted her own over-quick tongue to comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He let her arm drop from his with a swift gesture, and wheeled round to
      look her in the face. The glance in his eyes said so much to her that she
      hastened to anticipate his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; she urged hastily. &ldquo;It was silly thoughtlessness of mine. I
      do not know you at all well as yet, you know, and I say the wrong things
      to you. Do tell me you forgive me! And it is only fair to myself to say,
      too, that I have been in a bad school these last few years. Conversation
      as one practices it at Caermere is merely the art of making everything
      pointed and sharp enough to pierce thick skins. I should have remembered
      that you were different&mdash;it was unpardonable of me! But I have really
      angered you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian, still looking at her, found himself gently shaking his head in
      reassurance. It was plain enough to him that this beautiful young woman
      had suffered much, and that at the hands of his own people. What wonder
      that acrid memories of them should find their way to her lips? He also had
      been unhappy. He smiled gravely into her face at the softening
      recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were speaking of different things, I think,&rdquo; he commented, and nodded
      approval at sight of the relieved change which his tone brought to her
      countenance. &ldquo;I know very well there are many disagreeable and unpleasant
      matters close about us&mdash;when we are down below, there. But now we are
      up above them, and we forget them all, or ignore them&mdash;and I was
      asking you about the history of the family&mdash;its ancient history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand lightly upon his arm again. &ldquo;Lord Julius is right about
      it being a very, very long history,&rdquo; she said, putting into her voice a
      tacit recognition of his magnanimity. &ldquo;I know it, in a certain way, but I
      can hardly make a good story of it, I&rsquo;m afraid. The family is Keltic, you
      know. That is what is always said about it, as its most distinguishing
      characteristic. It is the only large English one which managed to survive
      through the Saxon period, and then the Norman period, and keep its name
      and its estates and its territorial power. This makes it very interesting
      to historians and archaeologists. There are many stone circles and Druidic
      monuments about here, some of which are said to be connected with the
      introduction of Christianity into Britain. You will see them another day,
      and read the legends about them. Well, it is said that the chief who
      possessed this land here, and who had some kind of a stronghold there
      where the castle is, at that time, was a Torr. Of course, there were no
      surnames then, but it would have been his tribal appellation, or something
      of the sort. The fact itself, I believe, is generally accepted&mdash;that
      the family that was here in St. David&rsquo;s time is here now. It is a
      tradition that there should always be a David in the family; it used to be
      the leading name, but now Christian is usually the duke&rsquo;s name, and the
      others are all saints, like Anselm, Edward, Augustine and&mdash;and so
      forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked down in meditation upon the gloomy, historic pile.
      &ldquo;It is a very grand beginning,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it was too grand for mere mortals to live up to,&rdquo; she ventured,
      with a cautious sidelong eye on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see your meaning,&rdquo; he assented, nodding. &ldquo;Yes, no doubt it is natural.
      It is as if a boy were named Napoleon. He would be frightened to think
      what he had done to make his name and himself fit together&mdash;and very
      likely he would never do anything at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is it,&rdquo; she answered, and drew a long, consolatory breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had begun to move down the wide winding path, and when they paused
      presently at one of the steps to note a new view of the buildings, she
      called his attention to something by a little exclamation and a pointing
      finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see the balcony there, up above and to the left of the flat-topped
      tower&mdash;no, this side of the highest chimneys&mdash;there are figures
      coming out on it from the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some one in a reclining chair, n&rsquo;est ce pas?&rdquo; he asked,
      following her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your grandfather,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Those are his apartments&mdash;the
      rows of windows with the white woodwork. When the sun gets round to them,
      they bring him out&mdash;if he is strong enough. Evidently this is one of
      his good days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian, gazing eagerly, made out beyond the attendants and the couch
      they bore, another figure, with a splash of white like a shield upon its
      front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not Julius?&rdquo; he asked swiftly, pressing her arm. &ldquo;Oh, then by this
      time my grandfather knows of me&mdash;knows that I am here! Should you not
      think so? And no doubt, since it is his good day, they will take me to see
      him. Is that not probable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; she responded, after a momentary pause,
      &ldquo;either as to what Lord Julius has told him, or as to how much he is
      capable of understanding. Except from this distance, I have not seen him
      since he was struck down with paralysis. I know nothing of his condition
      beyond a stray, guarded word now and then from the doctors. If I were a
      professional thief and he a crown jewel, I could not have been more
      securely shut out from him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The melancholy bitterness of her words, and tone appealed to the young
      man. He drew her hand closer to his side by a delicate pressure of the
      arm. &ldquo;I can see that you have been very unhappy,&rdquo; he said,
      compassionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh-h-h!&rdquo; she murmured, with a shuddering sigh. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t speak
      of it, I beg of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also have had a sad youth,&rdquo; he went on, unconsciously tightening his
      arm. &ldquo;But now&rdquo;&mdash;and he lifted his head and smiled&mdash;&ldquo;who knows?
      Who shall say that the bad days are not all gone&mdash;for both of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only the flutter of the hand against his arm made answer. They walked oh
      together down the broad sunlit path.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t the foot of the
      terraced slope, the wide, graveled path down which Lady Cressage had led
      Christian described a formal curve to the right, across a lawn which he
      recognized as belonging to his morning&rsquo;s experiences. The angle of the
      high, domed conservatory recalled itself to him. Beyond it, on the same
      side, would be the window from which he had quitted the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the left, a smaller footpath turned into still another garden, and he
      was glad that his companion moved this way. They were in a relatively
      small inclosure, hedged upon three sides by closely knit high walls of
      box; the straggling, untrimmed profusion of this tall growth, through
      which a multitude of sweet-briers thrust still farther upward their
      dipping and interlaced green rods, gave the place a homely if unkempt
      aspect. On the fourth side rose the blue-gray masonry of the castle itself&mdash;an
      ancient curtain stretched between two towers. The autumn sunlight lay upon
      this stained old wall, and warmed it, and glowed softly among the leaves
      and saffron blossoms of the great rose-tree trained upon it. This garden
      preserved the outlines of some former quaint arrangement of walks and
      beds, but these were comfortably softened everywhere, and in part
      obscured, by the untrammeled freedom of vegetation. Even over the
      moldering red tiles of the paths mosses had been suffered to creep
      unmolested. A few late roses were in bloom here and there, and at one
      corner there rose a colony of graceful white lilies, the scent of which
      filled the air. It was all very restful and charming, and Christian,
      pausing to gaze about him, gave little exclamations of pleasure at what he
      saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the center of the garden, surrounded by a low seat of weather-worn
      woodwork, was what seemed to be a fountain, culminating in a piece of
      statuary, so blackened and battered by time and storm that little could be
      made out of its creator&rsquo;s intentions. Christian, with some murmured
      inquiry, led the way toward this&mdash;and then perceived that Lord
      Julius, who had been sitting at the other and sunny side of the statue,
      was standing now in the path, confronting the new-comers with a friendly
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is <i>my</i> particular haunt at Caer-mere,&rdquo; he explained to the
      young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In so huge a place, one is lost if he does not fasten upon a special
      corner or nook of some sort, and send down roots in it and make it his
      own. This was my mother&rsquo;s garden, and for over fifty years now I have
      bargained with one generation of head gardeners after another to leave it
      alone&mdash;as she left it. When Cheltnam came, he was so famous a person
      that I submitted to his budding some new varieties on the old wall-rose
      there&mdash;but, bless me, even that is thirty years ago&mdash;before
      either of you was born. I see you young people have lost no time in
      becoming acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edith Cressage looked into the old gentleman&rsquo;s eyes for a moment before
      she replied. They had exchanged this same glance&mdash;on her side at once
      puzzled, suspicious, defiant; on his full of a geniality possibly pointed
      with cynicism&mdash;very often during the last four years, without
      affecting by it any prepossession or prejudice in either&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;We met
      by accident in the upper fruit-walk, and I introduced myself. It must be
      quite luncheon time. Shall we go in?&rdquo; She added, as upon an afterthought,
      and with another steadfast look into his face, &ldquo;I have promised to show
      him over the house and the castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirable!&rdquo; said Lord Julius, cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch. &ldquo;We will follow you in a very few moments, if we
      may. I dare say he is as ready for luncheon as I am, but I want to show
      him my old garden first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let me stop too!&rdquo; she exclaimed, without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation.
      &ldquo;May I confess it?&mdash;when you&rsquo;re not here I call it <i>my</i> garden,
      too. I knew it was your mother&rsquo;s&mdash;and I was always going to ask you
      to tell me about her, but the opportunity never offered. It is the one
      really perfect spot at Caermere, even to me. And I can understand how
      infinitely these old associations add to its charms for you! I shall truly
      not be in the way if I stop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elder man regarded her with a twinkling eye from under his broad
      hat-brim as he shook his head. &ldquo;To the contrary, we are both delighted,&rdquo;
       he answered, amiably enough. He began leading the way at this, and the two
      young people, walking perforce very close together on the narrow path,
      followed at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed out to them that the fountain, which he could not remember
      being in working order even in his boyhood, was built over the ancient
      well of the castle. The statue apparently dated from William and Mary&rsquo;s
      time; at least, it was very like the objects they set up at Hampton Court.
      Part of its pedestal was made of three Ogham stones, which were said to
      have stood by the well in former times. Flint knives and other primitive
      weapons had been found in the garden. Antiquaries were not agreed as to
      the possibility of the well having been in existence at any very remote
      period, but it was not unlikely that this small garden had been the center
      of interest&mdash;perhaps the scene of Druidical sacrifices, or even of
      the famous conversion of the tribe resident here by St. David&mdash;at the
      beginning of things. These speculations as to precise localities were
      interesting, but scarcely convincing. The wall at the end was a more
      definite affair. It had been built after the Third Crusade by Stephen de
      la Tour, as the Normanized name went then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the name has not always been spelled the same then?&rdquo; interrupted
      Christian here. He spoke with an eagerness which the abstract interest of
      the query seemed hardly to warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, no!&rdquo; said Lord Julius. &ldquo;It has been Tor with one &lsquo;r&rsquo; and with
      two; it has been de la Tour, as I said, and Tour without the &lsquo;de la,&rsquo; and
      Toure, and I know of at least one branch of the people of the name of
      Tower who are undoubtedly of our stock. It is quite conceivable that many
      others of them are, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the forms of names can be altered at will?&rdquo; pursued Christian. &ldquo;If a
      man says, &lsquo;I will spell it so and so,&rsquo; then it is all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; explained the other. &ldquo;Often two spellings exist side by side.
      Witness the Seymours a few years ago. You had one brother writing it
      Seymour and another St. Maur. The latter is now the official spelling&mdash;for
      the present, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is extremely interesting to me,&rdquo; the young man cried. &ldquo;So I may keep
      my name as I have always borne it! I may write myself &lsquo;Christian Tower&rsquo;!
      That lifts a load from my mind. I had been unhappy to think of abandoning
      the name my father liked. He always both spelled and pronounced it
      &lsquo;Tower,&rsquo; and that is why I shall be so glad to do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An acute kind of silence rested upon the group for an awkward minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let us have anymore archaeology before luncheon, Lord Julius,&rdquo;
       put in the lady then. &ldquo;Caermere so reeks with history that one must take
      it in small installments or be overwhelmed altogether. You were going to
      tell us about your mother, Lord Julius, and how you remember her, here in
      this dear old garden. And positively nothing has been changed since!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t go quite so far as that,&rdquo; said the old man, smilingly. He
      seemed grateful to her for the digression. &ldquo;A certain systematic
      renovation has, of course, been necessary; I have arranged with the
      gardeners to manage that. I dare say there are scarcely any plants or
      roots here now which were individually in existence in my mother&rsquo;s time;
      but their children, their descendants, are here in their places. Except
      for Cheltnam&rsquo;s buds on the wall there, I don&rsquo;t think any novelties have
      been introduced. If so, it was against my wish. The lilies in that corner,
      for example, are lineal progeny, heaven knows how many times removed, of
      the lilies my mother planted there. These roses are slips from other slips
      of the old cabbage and damask and moss roses she used to sit and look at
      with her crewel-work in her lap. The old flowers are gone, and yet they
      are not gone. In the same way, my mother has been dead for sixty years,
      and yet this is still her garden, and she is still here&mdash;here in the
      person of me, her son, and of Christian, her great-grandson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; commented Lady Cressage, upon a sudden smiling impulse, &ldquo;I alone
      am an intruding new species&mdash;like one of Cheltnam&rsquo;s &lsquo;niphetos&rsquo; buds
      on the old rose. I hasten to extricate myself.&rdquo; And with a bright little
      nod and mock half-courtesy, she caught her gown in one hand, wheeled round
      and moved quickly down the path and through the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men watched her till she vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a beautiful lady,&rdquo; observed Christian, with enthusiasm; &ldquo;and very
      courteous, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Julius offered no remark upon this, but stood for a little with his
      gaze apparently fixed on the point whence she had disappeared. Then,
      without turning his head, he said in a gently grave way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you, Christian, I would make as few allusions, in mixed
      company, to my father as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! this is what I desired to discuss with you!&rdquo; said the young man,
      stoutly. He swung round to face the other, and his eyes sparkled with
      impatience. &ldquo;Everybody avoids mention of him; they turn to something else
      when I speak his name&mdash;all but those abominable young men who offered
      him insult. That is what I should very much like to talk about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought it might not be necessary,&rdquo; replied Lord Julius. &ldquo;At least,
      I had hoped you would pick up the information for yourself&mdash;a
      harmless little at a time, and guess the rest, and so spare everybody,
      yourself included. But that is precisely what you seem not to do; and I
      dare say I was wrong in not talking frankly with you at the start. But let
      me understand first: what do you know about your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that he was a soldier, a professional soldier. That I have told
      you,&rdquo; panted Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and a very notable soldier,&rdquo; responded the other. &ldquo;He won the
      Victoria Cross in the Mutiny&mdash;the youngest man in all India to do so.
      That is for you to remember always&mdash;in your own mind&mdash;for your
      own pride and consolation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, always!&rdquo; murmured the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in other services, too, after he left England,&rdquo; the elder man went
      on, &ldquo;I have understood that he was a loyal and very valuable officer to
      those he fought for. This also is something for you to be proud of&mdash;-but
      still inside your own mind! That it is necessary to remember&mdash;that
      you must keep it to yourself. Forgive my repeating the injunction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; said Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Lord Julius began, speaking with more hesitation, &ldquo;Ambrose as a
      soldier was magnificent, but you know enough from your books to know that
      splendid soldiers may easily be&mdash;how shall I say?&mdash;not so
      splendid in other walks of life. It is to be said for him that he was bare
      twenty-three&mdash;poor boy. It was in 1859; and, as misery would have it,
      I was in Syria, traveling with my wife. Perhaps if I had been in England,
      I could have done something. As it was, there was no one to help him; and
      of course it may be that he couldn&rsquo;t have been helped. It was a case of a
      young man returning to London, with honors and flattery enough to turn
      even an old head, and walking blindfold into the worst company in Europe.
      I have no intention of going into details. You must take my word for it
      that suddenly four or five young men of great families fled to the
      Continent; and that, without much publicity in the papers, there was a
      very miserable sort of scandal after their flight. Other names were
      mentioned&mdash;but I needn&rsquo;t go into that. It was to the interest of many
      influential people to hush the thing up, and to some extent they
      succeeded. After a while it became even possible for the others to come
      back to England&mdash;there are many ways of managing such matters&mdash;but
      there was one of them who never returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian gazed into the old man&rsquo;s face with mute, piteous fixity of
      concentration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one, of course,&rdquo; Lord Julius pursued, picking his words still more
      cautiously, and liking his task less than ever, &ldquo;was your father. The way
      was smoothed for the rest to come back, but not for him&mdash;that is, at
      first. Later, when he could have returned, he would not. Ambrose had a
      stubborn and bitter temper. He was furious with his father, with his
      family&mdash;with all England. He would touch none of us. Why, I myself
      went to Sicily many years ago&mdash;it was as soon as I had got back from
      the East&mdash;and learned the facts, and found out what could be done;
      and I tried to see him, and bring him home with me, but he would not speak
      with me, or even remain under the same roof with me&mdash;and so I could
      do nothing. Or yes, there was one thing&mdash;that is to maintain some
      kind of watch over you&mdash;after his death, and that we did. My own idea
      was to have brought you over to England years ago&mdash;as soon as your
      mother died&mdash;but Emanuel thought otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused here in his narrative, for the reason that his companion was
      obviously no longer listening to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian had moved a step or two away, and with a white, set face was
      looking off over the hill-tops. His profile showed brows knitted and lips
      being bitten, under the stress of an internal tempest. It seemed to the
      old man a long time that he stood thus, in dry-eyed, passionate battle
      with his own mind. Then, with a sudden, decisive gesture he spread out his
      hands and turned impulsively to Lord Julius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an old man, and a wise one, and you were my father&rsquo;s friend and
      you are my friend!&rdquo; he said, with trembling earnestness. &ldquo;I should be a
      fool not to pay heed to what you tell me. You advise that I do not mention
      my father more than is necessary. Eh bien, I take your advice. Without
      doubt it is right&mdash;just as it is right that I should speak less of my
      brother Salvator. I have remembered that since you warned me, and now I
      will remember this. But I should like&rdquo;&mdash;he came forward as he spoke,
      still with extended hands, and looked with entreating earnestness up into
      the other&rsquo;s face&mdash;&ldquo;I should like to have you understand that Salvator
      is my brother not any the less, and that I love and honor and have pride
      in my father more than before. This I keep in my own mind, as you advise&mdash;but
      one thing I will do for every one to take note of. I will write my name
      always &lsquo;Tower.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great-uncle put a big, comforting hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;I should not
      dream of blaming you,&rdquo; he said, gently. &ldquo;But there is a man to tell us
      luncheon is ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded comprehension to the servant who had appeared at the opening in
      the hedge, and, still with his hand on Christian&rsquo;s shoulder, began to move
      in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One other matter,&rdquo; said the young man in lowered tones and hurriedly&mdash;&ldquo;from
      the hill above, awhile ago, I saw my grandfather&mdash;in his chair, on
      the balcony. You said just now that my father hated him&mdash;was furious
      with him. Did he behave cruelly to my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no-o,&rdquo; replied Julius, with an indefinite upward inflection on the
      deliberate negative. &ldquo;Not cruelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But unjustly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not unjustly, either&mdash;if only because he never in his life
      possessed the dimmest inkling of what justice meant. The duke is my
      brother, and I know him much better than any one else living, and so I am
      free to speak frankly about him. He has been a duke nearly eighty years&mdash;which
      is, I believe, unprecedented&mdash;but he has been an ass still longer
      than that.&rdquo; After a pause he added: &ldquo;I am going to take you to him this
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian hung his head as they walked along, and framed in his depressed
      mind more than one further inquiry about this grandsire of his, who held
      so august a station, and yet had been dismissed so contemptuously, but
      they did not translate themselves into speech. Nor, later, during the
      luncheon, was this great personage more than indirectly alluded to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way to this luncheon had led through three or four large rooms,
      opening one upon the other by small doors, the immediate approaches to
      which were given the effect of passageways by means of screens. What these
      apartments were used for, or how the residents of the castle distinguished
      them apart in their own minds, Christian could not imagine. To his rapid
      and curious inspection, they seemed all alike&mdash;each with its bare,
      indifferently polished floor, its huge stone fireplace, its wainscoting,
      walls and ceiling of dark, umber-hued wood, and its scant store of
      furniture which only heightened the ruling impression of big empty spaces.
      An occasional portrait was dimly to be discerned up in the duskiness of
      the oak panels, but the light from the narrow and small-paned windows was
      too faint to examine them by. More cheerless or apparently useless rooms
      the young man had never seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Julius seemed to guess his thoughts. &ldquo;This is all an old part&mdash;what
      might be called mid-Plantagenet,&rdquo; he explained, as they went along. &ldquo;My
      father had these rooms pulled about a good deal, and done up according to
      Georgian standards, but it was time and money wasted. Even if big windows
      were cut through they would be too dark for comfort, to our notions. The
      men who made them, of course, cared nothing at all about daylight, at
      least inside a house. They spent as little time as possible under roofs,
      to begin with; they rose at daybreak and went to bed at dark. When they
      were forced to be under cover, they valued security above all things, and
      the fewer openings there were in the walls, the better they liked it. They
      did no reading whatever, but after they had gorged themselves with food,
      sat around the fire and drank as much as they could hold, and listened to
      the silly rubbish of their professional story-tellers and ballad-singers
      till they fell asleep. If it happened that they wanted to gamble instead,
      a handful of rush-lights or a torch on the wall was enough to see the dice
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, what did they want more? And for that matter, what do most of
      their lineal descendants want more either? Light enough to enable them to
      tell a spade from a heart, and perhaps to decipher the label on a bottle
      now and then. Nothing more. The fashion of the day builds plate-glass
      windows round them, but it is truly a gross superfluity.&rdquo; The room in
      which Lady Cressage and the luncheon-table awaited them was of a more
      hospitable aspect. A broad expanse of lawn, and of distant trees and
      sky-line fading away in the sunny autumn haze, made a luminous picture of
      the high embrasured window stretching almost from corner to corner across
      one side. By contrast with the other apartments, the light here was
      brilliant. Christian, with a little apologetic bow and gesture to the
      others, dallied before the half-dozen portraits on the walls, examined the
      modeling of the blackened oak panels about them, and lingered in admiring
      scrutiny of the great carved chimney-piece above the cavernous hearth, on
      which a fire of logs crackled pleasantly. This chimney-piece was fairly
      architectural in its dimensions. It was as full of detail, and seemed
      almost as big, as the west front of a church, and he tipped his head back
      to look up at its intricate, yet flowing scheme of scrollwork, its
      heraldic symbolism used now for decoration, now to point the significance,
      as it were, of the central escutcheon&mdash;and all in old wood of so ripe
      a nut-brown color that one seemed to catch a fragrance exhaled from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the best thing here,&rdquo; said Edith Cressage, moving over to stand
      beside him. &ldquo;It came from Ludlow Castle. Those are the arms of the
      Mortimers. It <i>is</i> the Mortimers, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She turned to Lord
      Julius for support. &ldquo;I always confuse them with the De Lacys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the Mortimers,&rdquo; answered Julius, as servants entered, and they took
      their seats. &ldquo;But almost every other family of the Marches is represented
      in the devices scattered about. You can see the arrows of the Egertons,
      the eagles of the Grandisons, and up above, the corbies or ravens of the
      Corbets, and so on. That was the period when the Marches ruled England,
      and their great families, all married and intermarried and bolstered up by
      the feudal structure, were like a nation by themselves. The Mortimers, you
      know,&rdquo; he added, turning to Christian, &ldquo;became practically kings of
      England. At least they had their grandsons on the throne&mdash;but they
      couldn&rsquo;t hold it after they had got it. The day of these parts was really
      over before Bosworth Field. The printing press and Protestantism finished
      the destruction of its nobility. Only a house here and there has survived
      among us. Some few of the old names are preserved, like flies in amber,
      over in Ireland, but I should not know where to look to-day for a De Lacy,
      or a Tregoz, or a west country Le Strange, let alone a Mortimer. I
      suppose, in fact, we have more of the Mortimer blood among us than there
      is anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian, seated so that he faced the great armorial pageant spread as a
      background to the fair head of the lady, smiled wistfully at his
      companions, but said nothing. The words about his sharing the blood of
      kings were like some distant, soft music in his ears. He looked at the
      escutcheons and badges, and sought in a dreamy way to familiarize himself
      with the fact that they were a part of his own history&mdash;that the
      grandeur they told of was in truth his personal heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some talk going on between the others&mdash;conversation which,
      for a time, he scarcely strove to follow. Lord Julius had begun by
      expressing his joy at the absence from luncheon of the physician whom
      circumstances kept on the premises, and from this he drifted to an attack
      upon doctors as a class. He denounced them root and branch, as impostors
      and parasites, who darkened and embittered human life by fostering all the
      mean cowardices of smallbrained people, in order that they might secure a
      dishonest livelihood by pretending to dispel the horrors their own low
      tricks had conjured up. The robust old gentleman developed these violent
      theories without heat or any trace of excitement, and even maintained a
      genial expression of countenance while he spoke. Lady Cressage seemed
      entertained, and even helped on the diatribe now and again with pertinent
      quips of her own. But Christian could see very little sense in such an
      assault upon a respectable profession, and his attention wandered
      willingly again to the splendid chimney-piece. He resolved to learn all
      there was to learn of the heraldry and local history embodied in this
      sumptuous decoration, without delay. But then, on every conceivable side
      there was so much to learn!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he became aware that his thoughts had concentrated themselves on
      the extraordinary badness of the luncheon he was eating. Here at least was
      something Caermere could not teach him about&mdash;nor, for that matter,
      as it seemed, all England either. Since his arrival in the country, he
      reflected, he had not encountered one even tolerable dish. Vegetables and
      fish half raw, meats tasteless and without sauce or seasoning, bread heavy
      and sour, coffee unrecognizable, the pastry a thing too ridiculous for
      words&mdash;so his indictment shaped itself. He felt it his duty to argue
      to himself that quite likely this graceless and repellent diet was the
      very thing which made the English such physical and temperamental masters
      of the world, but the effort left him sad. He made a resolution that if
      ever Caermere were his a certain white-capped Agostino, in Cannes, should
      be imported forthwith. Then he became conscious again of what was being
      said at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could only imagine,&rdquo; Lady Cressage was saying to Lord Julius,
      &ldquo;what a boon your coming has been! I had positively almost forgotten what
      intelligent conversation was like. It seems ages since I last heard ten
      consecutive words strung together on a thought of any description. Let me
      see&mdash;it was June when you were last down, with Sir Benjamin Alstead;
      he has been here once since&mdash;but in your absence he put on such a
      pompous &lsquo;eminent-physician&rsquo; manner that really I oughtn&rsquo;t to count him at
      all&mdash;and with that exception, from June to October, civilization has
      left poor me entirely out of its reckoning. But perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;they had
      risen now, and there was a certain new frankness, almost confidence of
      appeal in her glance into his face&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps, as matters have turned,
      you will come oftener henceforth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Julius nodded. &ldquo;It is quite likely,&rdquo; he said, and stretched forth his
      hand significantly to Christian&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;But you were going to show
      him the house&mdash;and I suppose I may come along too. There is half an
      hour before we go to my brother&mdash;and our train does not leave Clune
      till nearly six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to-day! and he too?&rdquo; she exclaimed, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man nodded again. &ldquo;We are expected at Emanuel&rsquo;s to-night,&rdquo; he
      answered. Then, as Christian had moved toward the window and seemed beyond
      hearing, he added, in a smiling aside, &ldquo;There is one reason for dragging
      him away that is comical enough. It wouldn&rsquo;t do for him to dine at
      Caermere in morning clothes, and so far as I can see he has no others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could be too tired to dine,&rdquo; she suggested, quickly, in a confidential
      murmur. &ldquo;Or, for that matter, there is a room full of Porlock&rsquo;s things&mdash;I
      suppose&mdash;I suppose poor Cressage&rsquo;s&mdash;would be too big for him.
      Oh, it&rsquo;s too dreadful to have him whisked off like this! Can&rsquo;t you send a
      telegram instead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tone was as frank as her speech&mdash;and on the instant her glance at
      his face made keen inquiry whether it had not been too frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled in a tolerant, almost amused way. &ldquo;Oh, he will return all in
      good time,&rdquo; he assured her, gently enough. &ldquo;Caermere will see plenty of
      him, later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but who can tell where I shall be then?&rdquo; The necessity for speaking
      in an undertone gave her words an added intensity of feeling. &ldquo;And it
      isn&rsquo;t only him&mdash;I had hoped you would be stopping some days at least&mdash;for
      I wanted to speak with you about this very thing. My position here&mdash;the
      uncertainty of everything&mdash;is intolerable to bear.&rdquo; She lifted her
      head, and turned her direct gaze into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only you liked me a little better, I could discuss the matter more
      freely with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humbug!&rdquo; replied Lord Julius, with a geniality which was at least
      superficially reassuring. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t say such things, much less think
      them. I can understand your impatience&mdash;but it will be possible to
      straighten out affairs very soon now. I don&rsquo;t think you will be found to
      have suffered by the delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is all right,&rdquo; she answered, almost pettishly. &ldquo;Everybody
      assures me of the most magnanimous intentions&mdash;but in the meantime&rdquo;&mdash;she
      checked herself, tossed her head in resentment, apparently, at the tears
      which had started to her eyes, and forced herself to smile&mdash;&ldquo;in the
      meantime, you must forgive my tantrums. It is so depressing here&mdash;all
      alone&mdash;or worse than alone! I&rsquo;m really no longer fit to receive
      anybody. But now&rdquo;&mdash;she raised her voice in an eager simulation of
      gaiety&mdash;&ldquo;shall the personally conducted tour begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Caermere had been inaccessible to so many generations of sightseers that
      no formula for its exhibition remained. The party seemed to Christian to
      wander at haphazard through an interminable succession of rooms, many of
      them small, some of them what he could only think of as over-large, but
      all insufficiently lighted, and all suggesting in their meager
      appointments and somber dejection of aspect a stage of existence well
      along on the downward path to ruin. He had only to look about him to
      perceive why Caermere had long ago been removed from the list of England&rsquo;s
      show-places. His companions between them kept his attention busy with
      comments upon the history and purpose of the apartments they passed
      through, but beyond a general sense of futile and rather shabby immensity
      he gained very little from the inspection. The mood to postpone
      comprehension of what he was seeing to another and a more convenient time
      was upon him, and he almost willfully yielded to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, when impulse prompted him to climb a little ladder-like staircase,
      and push open a door from which the black dust fell in a shower, and he
      discerned in the gloom of the attic chamber piles of armor and ancient
      weapons, a thrill of fleeting excitement ran through his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that Prince Llewelyn&rsquo;s armor is there,&rdquo; called up Lord Julius
      from the landing below. &ldquo;Some day we will have it all out, and cleaned and
      furbished up. But don&rsquo;t go in now! You&rsquo;ll get covered with dirt. I used to
      venture in there and rummage about once in a while when I was a boy,&rdquo; he
      added as Christian came down. &ldquo;But even then one came out black as a
      sweep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were fine broad stretches of rugged landscape to be seen here and
      there from narrow casements in the older, higher parts they were now
      traversing, and occasionally Christian was able to interest himself as
      well in details of primitive, half-obliterated ornamentation over arches
      and doorways of early periods, but he was none the less almost glad when
      they came out at last into a spacious upper hallway, and halted in tacit
      token that the journey was at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I will leave you,&rdquo; said the lady, with lifted skirt and a foot poised
      tentatively over the first step of the broad descending stairs. &ldquo;I shall
      have tea in the conservatory when you come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian felt that something must be said. &ldquo;It has all been very
      wonderful to me,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;I am afraid I did not seem very
      appreciative&mdash;but that is because the place is too huge, too vast, to
      be understood quite at once. And I am so new to it all&mdash;you will
      understand what I mean. But I thank you very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled brightly on him and nodded to them both, and passed down the
      stairway. Christian was all at once conscious, as his eyes followed her,
      that there was a novel quickening or fluttering of his heart&rsquo;s action. For
      a brief second, the sensation somehow linked itself in his thoughts with
      the tall, graceful figure receding from him, and he bent forward to grasp
      more fully the picture she made, moving sedately along, with a hand like a
      lily on the wide black rail. Then he suddenly became aware that this was
      an error, and that he was trembling instead because the moment for
      confronting his grandfather had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Julius, indeed, had already opened a massive mahogany door at the
      right of the stairs, and signaled to him now to follow.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hat Christian
      first perceived about the duke&rsquo;s apartments was that they had an odor
      quite peculiar to themselves. The series of small and badly lighted
      anterooms through which he followed Lord Julius&mdash;rooms with
      pallet-beds, clothes hung against the walls, and other somewhat squalid
      signs of domestic occupation&mdash;were full of this curiously distinctive
      smell. It was not so obvious in the larger and better-lighted chamber
      beyond, which the doctor in residence had converted to his own uses, and
      where he sat now reading a book, merely rising momentarily to bow as they
      passed. But in the next room&mdash;the big sleeping apartment, with its
      faded pretensions of stateliness of appointment, and its huge, high-posted
      bed, canopied by old curtains embroidered with heraldic devices in
      tarnished gilt threads&mdash;the odor was more powerful than ever, despite
      the fact that a broad window-door was open upon the balcony beyond. The
      young man&rsquo;s keen sense was baffled by this pervasive scent&mdash;compounded
      as it seemed to be of all the ancient castle&rsquo;s mustiness, of sharp
      medicinal vapors and of something else at once familiar and unknown. He
      sniffed inquiringly at it, as they neared the window, and apparently Lord
      Julius heard him, for he remarked over his shoulder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the dogs that you smell. They&rsquo;ve practically removed the kennel up
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the stone floor of the balcony outside there were to be seen, indeed,
      some dozen old hounds, for the most part lying sleepily in the sunshine,
      with their heads pointed toward a large, half-covered reclining chair
      placed near the balustrade, and occasionally opening a drowsy eye to
      regard its occupant. There were a few dogs of other kinds as well,
      Christian noted upon a second glance, and one of these, a bulky black
      creature with a broad snout and hair curled tight like astrakhan fur, sat
      close to the chair and was thrusting its muzzle against a hand at its
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hand was what Christian saw first of his grandfather&mdash;an immense
      limp hand, with thick fingers twisted and misshapen, and skin of an almost
      greenish pallor. The dog&rsquo;s nose, thrust under it, moved this inert hand
      about, and the young man felt himself thrill unpleasantly, for some
      reason, at the spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the further end of the balcony two men in livery lounged against the
      wall, but upon a signal from Lord Julius they went in. The latter,
      threading his way among the hounds, led Christian round to the side of the
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Ambrose&rsquo;s boy,&rdquo; he said, bending a little and raising his voice.
      &ldquo;He is Christian, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon the chair was stretched, in a halfsitting posture, the gigantic frame
      of a very old man. The grandson looked upon him in silence for a long
      time, his mind confused with many impressions. The vast shoulders and
      high, bullet-like head, propped up by pillows in the partial shadow of the
      hood, seemed vaguely to recall the vision his baby memory had preserved of
      his own father. But in detail there was no resemblance. Or yes, there were
      resemblances, but they were blurred almost beyond recognition by the rough
      touch of time. The face, with its big, harsh features and bushing brows,
      and its frame of stiff white whiskers under the jaws and chin, had
      something in it which for an instant the young man seemed to identify;
      then the unnatural effect of its uniform yellow-clay color drove all
      thoughts of its human relationships from his mind, and he saw nothing but
      a meaningless mask. It was as devoid of significance, indeed, as if it had
      been in a coffin. The eyes were open and they seemed to be fixed upon the
      distant rolling prospect of hills and forest, but whether they were seeing
      anything, Christian could not imagine. They certainly had not been turned
      to include him in their survey. The livid right hand, swaying as the black
      dog pushed it with its nose, was the only thing about the duke that moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not know I am here,&rdquo; said Christian, at last. He spoke
      instinctively, with the ceremonious affectation of awe which one puts on
      in the presence of death. His grandfather hardly impressed him as being
      alive and still less made any appeal to his sense of kinship. He had
      expected to be overwhelmed with emotion at the meeting, but he found
      himself barely interested. His wandering glance chanced to take note of
      some of the dogs&rsquo; faces about the chair. They were all alertly watching
      him, and the profoundly wise look in their eyes caught his attention. No
      doubt they were dreadful fools, if the truth could be known, but the
      suggestion of cultured sagacity in their gaze was extraordinary. He looked
      back again at his grandfather, and tried to say to himself that he was a
      great noble, the head of an ancient and proud line, and the actual father
      of <i>his</i> father&mdash;but the effort failed to spur his fancy. He
      turned to Lord Julius and lifted his brows in wearied interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Move round in front of him,&rdquo; counseled the other. &ldquo;Get yourself in the
      range of his eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian obeyed, and, flushing a little with self-consciousness, strove
      to intercept the aged man&rsquo;s gaze. There was no change upon the ashen face
      under the hood to tell him whether he had succeeded or not. The impulse to
      grimace, to wave his arms about, to compel attention by any wild and
      violent device, forced him to smile in the midst of his perplexed
      constraint. He stared for a few moments longer at the gaunt, immovable
      figure&mdash;then shrugged his shoulders, and, stepping over a dog or two,
      made bold to rejoin Lord Julius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see that it is of any use,&rdquo; he said, with annoyance. &ldquo;If you
      wish to go, I am quite ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Julius lifted his brows in turn, and looked at his grand-nephew with
      curiosity. &ldquo;I said nothing about going, that I recall,&rdquo; he began, with an
      effect of reproof in his tone. But then he seemed to think better of it,
      and gave an abrupt little laugh. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very invigorating, I&rsquo;m bound to
      admit,&rdquo; he confessed, cheerfully enough. &ldquo;Wait a moment, and I&rsquo;ll stir him
      up a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent forward again, with his head at the edge of the hood, and shouted
      into it: &ldquo;If you want to see Ambrose&rsquo;s boy, here he is! If you don&rsquo;t want
      to see him, say so, and waste no more of our time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Christian&rsquo;s surprise, the duke took instant cognizance of this remark.
      His large face brightened, or at least altered its aspect, into something
      like animation; his eyes emerged from their cover of lethargy, and looked
      alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My back is very bad to-day,&rdquo; he remarked, in a voice which, though it
      bore the querulous note of the invalid, was unexpectedly robust in volume.
      &ldquo;And I cannot make out whether the numbness is passing down below my knee
      or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Julius nodded, as if confirming to himself some previous suspicion.
      &ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; he commented in an aside to the young man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      merely his endearing little way. Have patience, and we&rsquo;ll draw the badger
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bawled once more into the hood, with an added peremptoriness of tone:
      &ldquo;I explained it all to you, hours ago, and I&rsquo;m sure you understand it
      perfectly. Christian naturally wished to pay his respects to you, but if
      your back is too bad, why, there&rsquo;s no more to be said&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll be
      off. Goodbye to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I know his mother? Who was his mother? I have no recollection of
      her.&rdquo; The duke spoke peevishly, twitching his sunken lips in what was
      plainly an effort to pout them. Christian noted with curiosity that as he
      surrendered himself to such mental exertion as the talk demanded, the aged
      man&rsquo;s face grew disagreeably senile in effect. An infinity of
      gossamer-like wrinkles showed themselves now, covering the entire
      countenance in a minute network.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t know his mother!&rdquo; replied Lord Julius, with significant
      curtness. &ldquo;It is more to the point that you should know <i>him</i>, since
      he is to be your successor. Look at him&mdash;and say something to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duke managed to testify on his stiffened lineaments the reluctance
      with which he did what he was told, but he shifted his eyes in a sidelong
      fashion to take a brief survey of the young man. &ldquo;Cressage could have
      given you five stone ten,&rdquo; he said to him, brusquely, and turned his eyes
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian cast a look of bewildered inquiry up at Lord Julius, but
      encountered only a smile of contemptuous amusement. He summoned the
      courage to declare, in a voice which he hoped was loud enough: &ldquo;I am glad
      to hear, sir, that this is one of your good days. I hope you will have
      many more of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of this assurance His Grace seemingly took no note. After a short pause he
      began speaking again. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dog up here,&rdquo; he said, with the gravity
      befitting a subject to which he had given much thought, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m sure
      falls asleep, and yelps in her dreams, and disturbs me most damnably, and
      I believe it&rsquo;s that old bitch Peggy, and when I mention it the fellows
      swear that she&rsquo;s been taken away, but I suspect that she hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will look to it,&rdquo; put in Lord Julius perfunctorily. He added, upon an
      afterthought, &ldquo;Did the guns annoy you, this forenoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duke&rsquo;s thoughts were upon something else. He turned his eyes again,
      and apparently spoke to Christian. &ldquo;A good hearty cut across the face with
      a whip,&rdquo; he said, with kindling energy, &ldquo;is what&rsquo;d teach-swine like
      Griffiths their place&mdash;and then let &rsquo;em summons you and be
      damned. A farmer who puts up barbed-wire&mdash;no gentleman would listen
      to his evidence for a minute. Treat them like the vermin they are&mdash;and
      they&rsquo;ll understand that. Cressage had the proper trick with them&mdash;a
      kick in the stomach first and reasons afterward. That&rsquo;s the only way this
      country can be hunted. When I got to riding over eighteen stone, and
      couldn&rsquo;t take anything, that ruffian Griffiths screwed up his gates and
      sent me round the turnpike like a damned peddler, and Ambrose&mdash;it was
      Ambrose, wasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;or am I thinking of Cressage? But they weren&rsquo;t
      together&mdash;here, Julius! It was you who were speaking of Ambrose! What
      about him? By God, I wish he had my back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Julius, with the smile in his beard hardening toward scorn, took
      Christian by the arm. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve had enough grandfather to go on
      with,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;Never mind making your adieux. They would be
      quite wasted on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without further words, they turned and moved away through the dogs to the
      window, and so into the house. The doctor, still at his book, rose once
      more upon their approach, and this time Lord Julius halted to speak with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Grace seems to ramble in his mind a good deal more than he did before
      luncheon. Do you see a change in this respect&mdash;say week by week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not observable in gradations, Lord Julius,&rdquo; answered the physician,
      a stout, sandy young man, who assumed his air of deference with
      considerable awkwardness; &ldquo;sometimes he recovers a very decided lucidity
      after what had seemed to be a prolonged lapse in the other direction. But
      on the whole I should say there was a perceptible&mdash;well, loss of
      faculty. He knows the dogs, however, quite as well as ever&mdash;distinguishes
      them apparently by touch, remembers all their names, and recalls anecdotes
      about them, and, very often, about their mothers too. Fletcher tells me
      His Grace hasn&rsquo;t once miscalled a hound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They make an abominable atmosphere up here,&rdquo; commented the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor smiled lugubriously. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t deny that, Lord Julius,&rdquo; he
      replied, &ldquo;but all the same they are the most important part of the
      treatment. If we took them away, His Grace would die within the week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy dogs!&rdquo; mused Lord Julius, partly to himself, and walked on. It
      was not until they were half-way down the big staircase that Christian
      felt impelled to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should much like to know,&rdquo; he began, with diffident eagerness&mdash;&ldquo;you
      have already spoken so plainly about my grandfather&mdash;the question
      will not seem rude to him, I hope&mdash;but when he was well, before the
      paralysis, was he in any respect like what he is now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say,&rdquo; answered Lord Julius, in a reflective way, &ldquo;that he is at
      present rather less objectionable than formerly. One can make the excuse
      of illness for him now&mdash;and that covers a multitude of sins. But when
      he was in health&mdash;and he had the superb&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;riotous
      health of a whale&mdash;he was very hard to bear. You have seen him and
      you have observed his mental and moral elevation. He remembers his dogs
      more distinctly than he does his children. In the Almanach de Gotha he is
      classed among princes, but what he dwells upon most fondly among his
      public duties is the kicking of tenant-farmers in the stomach when they
      try to save their crops from being ruined by the hunt. I may tell you, I
      was in two minds about taking you to him at all, and now I think I regret
      having done so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; said Christian, thoughtfully. &ldquo;It is better as it is. I am glad to
      have seen him, and to have you tell me about him, frankly, as you have
      done. It all helps me to understand the position&mdash;and it seems that
      there is a great deal that needs to be understood. I can see already that
      there is strange blood in the Torrs.&rdquo; He paused on the bottom step as he
      spoke, and turned to his companion with a wistful smile. &ldquo;There is an even
      bolder question I should like to ask&mdash;how does it happen that <i>you</i>
      are so different? How do you account for yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Julius laughed. &ldquo;Oh, that is a long story,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I can put
      it into a word for you. I was made by my wife. I married a woman so noble
      and clever and wise and strong that I couldn&rsquo;t help becoming a decent sort
      of fellow in spite of myself. But I am going to talk to you about all
      that, later on. It is better worth talking about than anything else under
      the sun. Oh&mdash;Barlow, please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old butler had passed from one door to another in the hall, and turned
      now as he was called, with a hand behind him upon the knob. Lord Julius,
      approaching, exchanged some words with him upon the subject of his
      afternoon&rsquo;s plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian, watching this venerable servant with curiosity, as a type novel
      to his experience, discovered suddenly that his scrutiny was being
      returned. Barlow, while listening attentively and with decorously slow
      nods of comprehension to what was being said to him, had his eyes fixed
      aslant, beyond his interlocutor&rsquo;s shoulder, upon the young stranger.
      Christian encountered this gaze, and saw it waver and flutter aside, as
      from force of polite habit, and then creep back again. This happened more
      than once, and Christian began to feel that it had some meaning. He
      observed that the butler inclined his head at last and whispered something&mdash;his
      pale, wan old face showed it to be an inquiry&mdash;into the other&rsquo;s ear.
      The action explained itself so perfectly that Christian was in no way
      surprised to see Lord Julius turn smilingly, and nod toward himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is Ambrose&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He has come to take his place. I
      know you for one won&rsquo;t be sorry&mdash;eh, Barlow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was clear to the young man&rsquo;s perceptions that Lord Julius spoke as to
      one who was a friend as well as a servant. The note of patriarchal
      kindness in the tone appealed gratefully to him, and the affectionate
      mention of his father&rsquo;s name was sweet in his ears. A strange thrill of
      emotion, a kind of aimless yet profound yearning, possessed him as he
      moved forward. On the instant he realized that this was how he had
      expected to feel in the presence of his grandfather. The fact that the
      tenderness within him was appealed to instead by this gentle, sad-eyed old
      family dependant seemed to him to have something beautiful and very
      touching in it. Tears came into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember my father, then,&rdquo; he said, and the breaking of his voice
      carried him into the heart of this sudden new mood of self-abandonment.
      &ldquo;You would have known him as a little child&mdash;yes?&mdash;and you&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;
       he paused, to dash away the tears with his hand, and strive to regain some
      control over his facial muscles&mdash;&ldquo;you will have in your memory the
      good things about him&mdash;the boyish, pleasant things&mdash;and you
      loved him for them, did you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Barlow, trembling greatly, and with a faint flush upon his white
      cheeks, stared confusedly at the young man as he advanced. &ldquo;I held him on
      his first pony, sir,&rdquo; he stammered forth, and then shook his head in token
      that he could utter no more. His glistening eyes said the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian flung his arms round the surprised old man&rsquo;s neck, and kissed
      him on both cheeks, and then, with head bowed upon his shoulder, sobbed
      aloud.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he music of a
      spirited and tireless band of robins helped Christian to wake next
      morning. The character of their cheerful racket defined itself very slowly
      to his drowsy consciousness. He lay for a long time with closed eyes,
      listening to it, and letting his mind drift quite at random among the
      thoughts which it suggested. He knew they were robins because his hostess
      had said he would hear them; he lazily pictured to himself the tiny
      red-breasts gathered in the shrubbery outside, in obedience to some
      mysterious signal of hers, and singing to order thus briskly and
      unwearyingly to make good her promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what gay, high spirits the little fellow sang! The sun must be shining,
      to account for so much happiness. He accepted the idea with a sense of
      profound pleasure, and appropriated it to his own wonderful case.
    </p>
    <p>
      For him, it was as if happiness had never existed before.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wilt thou have music? Hark! Apollo plays,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And twenty cagéd nightingales do sing.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He murmured the lines in indolent reverie, then opened his eyes, and
      smiled to think where he was, and what he had become a part of. Lifting
      himself on his elbow, he looked about him. The beauties of the apartment
      had not been lost upon him the previous evening. He had carried them with
      him in vague processional magnificence on his devious march through
      dreamland; he surveyed them again now in the morning light, rising after a
      while to pull aside the curtains, and bring in the full sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was, he said over and over to himself, &lsquo;the most exquisite thing
      he had ever seen. The ruling color was of some blue which could almost be
      thought a green, and which, embraced as complementary decoration many
      shades of ocher and soft yellowish browns in woodwork, and in the thick,
      fleecy rugs underfoot. Around the four sides, at the level of his eyes,
      ran a continuous band of portraits&mdash;the English drawings of Holbein
      reproduced in the dominant tint of the room, set solidly into the wall,
      and separated from one another only by thin strips of the same tawny oak
      which framed them at top and bottom. The hooded, high-bosomed ladies, the
      cavaliers in hats and plumes and pointed beards, the smoothfaced,
      shrewd-eyed prelates and statesmen in their caps and fur, all knew him
      this morning for one of their own, as he went along, still in his
      nightshirt, and inspected them afresh. They appeared to greet him, and he
      beamed at them in response.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dim impression of the earlier morning, which had seemed a shadowy
      passing phase of his dreams, revealed itself now to him as a substantial
      fact. Some one <i>had</i> been in the room, moving noiselessly about, and
      had spread forth for his use a great variety of articles of clothing and
      of the toilet, most of which he beheld for the first time. Overnight, his
      cousin Emanuel&rsquo;s insistence upon his regarding everything in the house as
      his own for the time being, had had no definite significance to his mind.
      He looked now through the array of silks and fine cloths, of trinkets in
      ivory and silver and polished metals, and began dressing himself with a
      long sigh of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recollections of the leave-taking at Caermere straggled into his thoughts
      as he pursued the task. He had seen Lady Cressage again in the
      conservatory, where she wore another dress, and had her beautiful hair
      carefully arranged as if in his honor, and poured out tea for him and Lord
      Julius in wonderful little cups which his great-grandfather, a sailor, had
      brought from China. Of her conversation he recalled little, and still less
      of the talk of the other lady, the actress-person, Mrs. Edward, who had
      joined the party, but whose composed pretty face had been too obviously a
      mask for anguish not to dampen everybody&rsquo;s spirits. He wondered now, as he
      plied his razor on the strap, what had become of her husband, and of that
      poor-spirited brother of his. Had they joined the pheasant-shooters, after
      their interview with him? The temptation to fire upon themselves instead
      of the birds must have sorely beset them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was pleasanter to begin the retrospect some hours later, when the
      rough country of the Marches, and even Bristol, had been left behind. Lord
      Julius had explained to him then, as darkness settled upon the low,
      pasture-land levels they were swinging along past, that Somerset was also
      a county of the Torrs; two of their three titles were derived from it,
      indeed, and Somerset marriages had brought into the family, in the days
      following the downfall of the monasteries, some of the most important of
      its estates. If the dukes had turned their backs on Caermere two centuries
      ago, and made their principal seat here in this gentler and more equable
      land, perhaps the family history might have been different. Christian had
      absorbed the spirit rather than the letter of his companion&rsquo;s remarks.
      English counties were all one to him, but intuitively he had felt that he
      was getting into a kindlier and more congenial atmosphere. Although it was
      a black night, he had stared a good deal at the window, trying to discern
      some tokens of this change in the dimly lighted, empty stations they
      glided through, or paused reluctantly in.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had finally quitted the train at Bridgewater, and had got under
      way inside the carriage waiting for them there, Christian had asked
      whether it was not true that the railway servants here were more
      courteously obliging than they had been in other parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Julius had lightly remarked that it might be so; very likely,
      however, it was some indirect effect of the general psychical change the
      family underwent in shifting its territorial base. Then he had gone on
      more gravely, alluding for the first time to the episode of the butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be prepared to find everything very different, here,&rdquo; he had
      said. &ldquo;There is such a thing as having too much past&mdash;especially when
      it is of the wrong sort. Caermere is as tenacious of its memories as a
      prison&mdash;and they are as unpleasant. It forces upon you its air of
      never forgetting a single one of its miseries and injuries&mdash;and you
      feel that it cannot remember any compensating joys. I could see how the
      effect of it got into your blood, and broke your nerve. Under ordinary
      circumstances men do not kiss their butlers, or even sob on their bosoms.
      But I understood perfectly how old Barlow appealed to you. As you beheld
      him he might have stood as model for a statue of the Family Grief, choking
      down its yearning to wail over the generations gone to the bad. It was all
      right, what you did. For that matter, I was precious near raising a howl
      of lamentation myself. One is always alternating between tears and curses
      in that criminal old coalmine of a castle. But now you are over a hundred
      miles away from it all&mdash;and if it was a thousand the difference
      couldn&rsquo;t be greater. You will find nothing whatever to cry about down
      here. Nobody has any bad dreams. There isn&rsquo;t a cupboard that ever
      sheltered a skeleton even overnight. In these parts, remarkable as it may
      seem, the Torrs are actually regarded with admiration&mdash;quite the salt
      of the earth&mdash;a trifle eccentric, perhaps, but splendid landlords,
      capable organizers, uncommonly good masters&mdash;and above all, happy
      people who insist that everybody about them shall be happy too. It was
      important to show you the other side first&mdash;at least that was what we
      decided upon, but you are done with that now&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll give you
      something to take the taste out of your mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian recalled these assurances, now, with a delicious sense of being
      already enfolded and upheld by the processes of their fulfillment. The
      details of his reception at the broad, hospitably lighted door of
      Emanuel&rsquo;s house crowded in upon his memory, and merged themselves with
      other recollections of the later evening hours&mdash;the supper, the long,
      calm, sweetly intimate talk before the fire, the honest, wise, frankly
      affectionate faces into which he had looked to say &ldquo;good-night&rdquo;&mdash;it
      almost overwhelmed him with its weight of unimagined happiness. He had
      hardly guessed before what other men might mean when they gave a loving
      sound to the word &ldquo;home.&rdquo; Yet now the doors of such a home as he could
      never have dreamed of had opened to him&mdash;to him, the homeless, lonely
      one! and he was nestled securely in the warm heart of its welcome. He
      could have groaned aloud under the burden of his rapture at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he went downstairs, his misgivings about the hour not quite
      allayed by recollection of the parting injunction to sleep his fill and
      get up when he liked. There were beautiful things to note and linger over
      on every side as he made his way&mdash;pictures and armor and wonderful
      inlaid work and tapestries, all subordinating themselves with
      distinguished good breeding to the fact that they were in a home and not a
      museum&mdash;but he moved along in rather conscience-stricken haste toward
      the part of the house which had seemed to him the previous night to be the
      center of domestic life. He formed a sudden resolution, as he explored the
      lower hallway, that when he got some money his first purchase should be of
      a watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      After looking into a couple of rooms which were clearly not what he
      sought, Christian opened the right door, and confronted a breakfast-table,
      shining in its snowy attractiveness midway between a window full of
      sunlight and a brightly tiled chimney-place, with a fire on the hearth.
      There was no one in the room, and he stood for some minutes looking about
      him, liking very much the fresh, light-hued cheerfulness of everything,
      but still wishing that some one would come to pour his coffee. By degrees,
      he assimilated the idea that the ingredients of breakfast were all here to
      hand. There were dishes beside the fire, and this was apparently the
      coffee-pot on the table&mdash;a covered urn, with a thin spirit-flame
      trembling beneath it. He had reached the point of deciding to help himself&mdash;or
      should he ring the bell instead?&mdash;when the door opened and the lady
      of the house came bustling in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Emanuel, as he styled her in his thoughts, looked the very spirit of
      breakfast&mdash;buoyant, gay-hearted and full of the zest of life. Last
      night, to the young man&rsquo;s diffident though strenuous inspection, she had
      seemed the embodiment of tender hospitality in general. Though his glances
      were more confident now, in the brilliant morning light, she still gave
      the impression of personifying the influences which she made felt about
      her, rather than exhibiting a specific personal image. She was not tall,
      nor yet short; her face pleased the eye without suggesting prettiness; she
      had the dark, clear skin and rounded substance of figure which the mind
      associates with sedate movements and even languor, but she herself moved,
      thought, spoke with alert vivacity. Above all things, a mellow
      motherliness in her had struck the forlorn youth the previous evening. Now
      it seemed much more like the sweet playfulness of a fond elder sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You took me at my word; that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; she said to him, as they shook
      hands. &ldquo;I was afraid the man might disturb you, or give you the idea you
      were expected to get up. And do you feel perfectly rested now? A day or
      two more will do it, at all events. If I&rsquo;d known how they were dragging
      you about, by night and by day! But your Uncle Julius has no knowledge of
      even the meaning of the word fatigue. Sit here, won&rsquo;t you&mdash;and now
      here&rsquo;s bacon for you, and here&rsquo;s fish taken this very morning, and eggs
      I&rsquo;ll ring for to be done as you like them, and how much sugar to your
      coffee? You mustn&rsquo;t think this has been boiling ever since morning. It was
      made when you were heard moving about in your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be so sorry to have kept anybody waiting,&rdquo; he began, in shy
      comment upon the discovery that he was eating alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed at him with cordial frankness. &ldquo;Waiting?&rdquo; she echoed merrily.
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s about three o&rsquo;clock. Lord Julius is nearly in London by this
      time, and the rest of us have not only breakfasted, but lunched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Julius gone?&rdquo; he asked with wide-open eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, and raised a reassuring hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing but business.
      Telegrams came early this morning which took him away by the first train.
      He would have gone later in the day in any case. He left the most fatherly
      adieux for you&mdash;and of course you&rsquo;ll be seeing him soon in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian was puzzled. &ldquo;But this is his home here, is it not?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all&mdash;more&rsquo;s the pity,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;We wish for nothing so
      much as that he might make it so&mdash;but he elects instead to be the
      slave of the family, and to work like a bank-clerk in Brighton instead of
      cutting himself free and living his own life like the rest of us, in God&rsquo;s
      fresh air. But he comes often to us&mdash;whenever the rural mood seizes
      him.&rdquo; She seemed to comprehend the doubtful expression on the youth&rsquo;s
      face, for she added smilingly: &ldquo;And you mustn&rsquo;t be frightened to be left
      alone with us. You&rsquo;re as much our blood as you are his&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t think that!&rdquo; he pleaded impulsively. &ldquo;I was never so glad to be
      anywhere in my life as I am to be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her gray eyes regarded him with kindly softness. He saw that they were
      only in part gray eyes&mdash;that they were both blues and browns in their
      beautiful coloring, and that the outer edge of the iris deepened in tint
      almost to the black of the splendid lashes. He returned her look, and held
      it with a tentative smile, that he might the longer observe the remarkable
      eyes. All at once it flashed upon him that there was a resemblance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your eyes are like my mother&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said, as if in defensive explanation
      of his scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about your mother,&rdquo; she rejoined, putting her arms on the table
      and resting her chin upon a finger. &ldquo;I do not think I ever heard her
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Coppinger&mdash;Mary Coppinger. I never saw the name anywhere
      else.&rdquo; He added hesitatingly: &ldquo;My brother told me that her father was a
      soldier&mdash;an officer&mdash;who became in his old age very poor, and
      was at last a gardener for some rich man at Malta, and my mother gave
      lessons as a governess to support herself, and it was there she met my
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady seemed most interested in the name. &ldquo;Coppinger, is it!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, nodding her head at him. &ldquo;No wonder my heart warmed at the
      sight of you. Why, now, to look at you&mdash;of course you&rsquo;re County Cork.
      You&rsquo;re our slender dark type to perfection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I do not understand,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, she could not have that name and be anything but a County Cork
      woman. Who ever heard of a Coppinger anywhere else? Only it is pronounced
      with a soft &lsquo;g,&rsquo; not hard, as you speak it. I wonder&mdash;but that can
      wait; her father will be easily enough traced. And so you are an Irishman,
      too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian looked abashed at the confusing suggestion. &ldquo;I think I am all
      English,&rdquo; he said vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed again. &ldquo;Are you turning your back on us? Did you not know it?
      I also am Irish. No doubt I am some sort of cousin of yours on my own
      account, as well as on Emanuel&rsquo;s. There are Coppingers in my own family,
      and in most of those that we have intermarried with. Your mother was a
      Protestant, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head apprehensively, as if fearful that his answer must give
      pain. &ldquo;No, she went to mass like other people, and I was sent to the
      Brothers of the Christian School. But she was not in any degree a <i>dévotée</i>,
      and for that matter,&rdquo; he added in a more confident tone, &ldquo;I myself am
      still less <i>dévot</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; was her only comment, and he quite failed to gather from it any clue
      to her sentiments on the subject. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she began again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not put
      you through any more of your catechism now. Are you finished? Then come
      with me and we will find Emanuel, and incidentally you will see the place&mdash;or
      portions of it. It will take you a long time to see it all. Do you want to
      smoke? Put some of these cigars in your pocket&mdash;or here are
      cigarettes if you prefer them. Oh, we smoke everywhere. There is nothing
      on earth that we want to do that we don&rsquo;t do&mdash;and there&rsquo;s nothing we
      don&rsquo;t want to do that any mortal power can make us do. There you have the
      sum of our philosophy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had followed her into the hallway, where the doors were open wide to
      the mellow autumn afternoon. He put on the soft shapeless hat she gave him
      from a collection on the antlers, and was inspired to select a stick for
      himself out of the big standful at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I shall walk about,&rdquo; he said, gaily, &ldquo;quite as if I had never been
      out of England in my life. Is your husband&mdash;perhaps-shooting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed always to laugh at him. Her visible merriment at his question
      dashed his spirits for an instant. Then he saw how genial and honest was
      her mirth, and smiled himself in spontaneous sympathy with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dream of suggesting it to him!&rdquo; she adjured the young man, with
      mock solemnity. &ldquo;He has a horror of the idea of killing living creatures.
      He does not even fish for sport&mdash;though I confess I hardly follow him
      to that length. And don&rsquo;t speak of him in that roundabout way, but call
      him Emanuel, and call me Kathleen or Kit&mdash;whichever comes easiest.
      Merely because Thom&rsquo;s directory swears we&rsquo;re forty years old, we&rsquo;re not to
      be made venerable people by you. All happy folk belong to the same
      generation, no matter when they were born&mdash;and&mdash;but here is
      Emanuel now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been telling Christian,&rdquo; she continued, addressing her husband as
      he paused at the foot of the steps, &ldquo;that he is to be happy here, even in
      spite of himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel shook hands with his cousin, and nodded pleased approval of his
      wife&rsquo;s remark. His smile, however, was of a fleeting sort. &ldquo;Nothing has
      come of the Onothera experiments,&rdquo; he announced to her in a serious tone.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we must give up the idea of the yellow fuchsia.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>manuel Torr, at
      the age of forty, was felt by those who knew and loved him almost to have
      justified the very highest of the high hopes which his youth had
      encouraged. This intimate circle of appreciation was rendered a small one
      by the circumstances of his temperament and choice of career; but beyond
      this his name was familiar to many who had never seen him, or who
      remembered him at best as a stripling, yet who habitually thought and
      spoke of him as an example and model to his generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Oxford, twenty years before, he had attracted attention of a sort
      rather peculiar to himself. Those who took note of him saw foreshadowed
      the promise, not so much of great achievements as of the development and
      consolidation of a great influence. He was not specially distinguished in
      his work at the University, and he made no mark at the Union, where there
      happened at the time to be glittering a quite exceptional galaxy of future
      front bench men, judges and bishops. In Emanuel&rsquo;s case, the interest he
      aroused was perhaps more sentimental than intellectual. His mind was seen
      to be of a fine order, but his character was even more attractive to the
      observant eye. The facts that he was half Jewish in blood, and that in
      time he would be the possessor of enormous wealth, no doubt lent an added
      suggestion of romance to the picture of delicate, somewhat coldly modeled
      features, of ivory skin and serious, musing dark eyes, and of a rare smile
      of wonderful sweetness, which Oxford men of the mid-seventies still
      associate with his name. It was in the days when Disraeli&rsquo;s remarkable
      individuality was a part of England&rsquo;s current history, and when the
      English imagination, in part from the stimulus of this fact, dwelt upon
      the possibilities of a new Semitic wave of inspiration and ethical
      impetus. The dreams, the aspirations, the mysterious &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; of Daniel
      Deronda were in men&rsquo;s minds, and Johannesburg had not been so much as
      heard of.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the University recognized in the youth standing upon the threshold of
      manhood, had been an article of faith within his home since his childhood.
      It is as well to recount at this place the brief story of that home.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of twenty-five Lord Julius Torr, engaged in the listless
      pursuit of that least elusive of careers, called diplomacy, found himself
      at The Hague, and yawned his way about its brightly scrubbed solitudes for
      some months, until, upon the eve of his resolve to have done with the
      whole business, and buy a commission in a line regiment, he encountered a
      young woman who profoundly altered all his plans in life. It was by the
      merest and unlikeliest of accidents that he came to know the Ascarels,
      father and daughter, and at the outset his condescension had seemed to him
      to be involved as well. They were of an old family in the Netherlands,
      Jewish in race but now for some generations estranged from, the synagogue,
      and reputed to be extraordinarily wealthy. It was said of them too that
      they were sternly exclusive, but to the brother of an English duke this
      had not appeared to possess much meaning. He had previously been of some
      official service to the father, in a matter wherein Dutch and English
      interests touched each other at Sumatra; from this he came to meet the
      daughter. He had been told by the proud father that she was of the blood
      of the immortal Spinoza, and had been so little impressed that he had not
      gone to the trouble of finding out who Spinoza was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage of young Torr, of the Foreign Office, to some Dutch-Jewish
      heiress a half-year later, received only a trifle more notice in England
      than did the news of his retirement from his country&rsquo;s diplomatic service.
      The duke had already four sons, and the brother, when it seemed that he
      intended to live abroad, was not at all missed. Nearly fifteen years
      elapsed before a mature Lord Julius reappeared in England&mdash;a Lord
      Julius whom scarcely any one found recognizable. He bore small visible
      relation to the aimless and indolent young attaché whom people, by an
      effort of memory, were able to recall; still less did he resemble anything
      else that the Torr family, within recollection, had produced. He took a
      big old house in Russell Square, and in time it became understood that
      very learned and intellectual people paid pilgrimages thither to sit at
      the feet of Lady Julius, and learn of her. Smart London rarely saw this
      Lady Julius save at a distance&mdash;in her carriage or at the opera. The
      impression it preserved of her was of a short, swarthy woman, increasingly
      stout as years went on, who peered with near-sighted earnestness through a
      large pince-nez of unusual form. On her side, it seemed doubtful if she
      had formed even so succinct an impression as this of smart London. She was
      content with Bloomsbury to the end of her days; and made no effort
      whatever to establish relations with the West End. Indeed, tales came to
      be told of the effectual resistance she offered, in later years, to
      amiable interested advances from that quarter. It grew to be believed that
      she had made an eccentric will, and would leave untold millions to Atheist
      charities. The rumor that she was among the most highly cultivated women
      of her time, and that the most illustrious scientists and thinkers would
      quit the society of kings to travel post-haste across Europe at her
      bidding, did not, it must regretfully be added, seem incompatible with
      this theory about a crazy will. Finally, when she died in 1885, something
      was printed by the papers about her philanthropy, and much was said in
      private speculation about her disposition of her vast fortune, but it did
      not come out that any will whatever was proved, and London ceased to think
      of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outer world had in truth been wrong from the beginning. Lady Julius
      was not a deeply learned woman, and the limited circle of friends she
      gathered about her contained hardly one distinguished figure, in the
      popular use of the phrase; her opinions were not notably advanced or
      unconventional; she did not shun society upon philosophic principles, but
      merely because it failed to attract a nature at once shy and practical; so
      far from being rich in her own right, she had insisted many years before
      her death upon transferring every penny of her fortune to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside her own household, this dark, stout little woman with the
      eye-glasses was revered as a kind of angel. She was plainfaced almost to
      ugliness in the eyes of strangers. Her husband and her son never doubted
      that she was beautiful. Now, when she had been a memory for ten years and
      more, these two talked of her lovingly and with no constraint of gloom, as
      if she were still the pivot round which their daily life turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder man particularly delighted in dwelling upon the details of that
      earlier change in him, under her influence, to which allusion has been
      made. Emanuel had in his mind, from boyhood, no vision more distinct or
      familiar than this selfpainted picture of his father&mdash;the idle,
      indifferent, unschooled, paltry-ideaed young gentleman of fashion&mdash;meeting
      all unawares this overpowering new force, and kneeling in awed yet
      rapturous submission before it. To the boy&rsquo;s imagination it became a
      historical scene, as fixed and well known in its lines of composition as
      that of Nelson&rsquo;s death in the cockpit. He saw his beardless father in
      dandified clothes of the Corn-Laws-caricature period, proceeding along the
      primrose path of dalliance, like some flippant new Laodicean type of Saul
      of Tarsus&mdash;when &ldquo;suddenly there shined around him a light from
      heaven.&rdquo; Lord Julius, indeed, thought and spoke of it in much that same
      spirit. The recollection that he had not known who Spinoza was tenderly
      amused him: it was the symbol of his vast oceanic ignorance of all things
      worth knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; the son used to say, &ldquo;but if you had not had within yourself
      all the right feelings&mdash;only lacking the flash to bring them out&mdash;you
      would not have seen how wonderful she was. You would not have understood
      at all, but just passed on, and nothing would have happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the father, smiling in reverie, and stroking his great beard, would
      answer: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that that follows. I remember what I was like quite
      vividly, and really there was nothing in me to explain the thing at all. I
      was a young blood about town, positively nothing more. No, Emanuel, we may
      say what we like, but there are things supernatural&mdash;that is, beyond
      what we can see, and are prepared for, in nature. It was as unaccountable
      as magic, the effect your mother produced upon me from the beginning. At
      the end of a few hours, when it was time for me to take my leave, and I
      turned&mdash;there was a gulf in front of me, cutting me off from where I
      had been before I came to her, that very day. It was so wide, it seemed
      that I could barely see across it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To any listener but Emanuel such language must have been extravagant. To
      him there were no words for overpraise of his mother. It was not alone
      that he had never seen her in anger or even vexation; that he had never
      known her to be in error in any judgment, or suspected in her an
      uncharitable or unkindly thought. These were mere negations, and the
      memory of her was full of positive influences, all wise and pure and
      lofty. Very early in life, when he began to look about the world he found
      himself in, he learned to marvel that there were no other such women
      anywhere to be seen. She had been so perfect, with seemingly no effort to
      herself! Why should other women not even try?
    </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel had been born some ten years after the marriage of his parents,
      and they thus came into his baby consciousness as persons of middle age,
      in appearance and its suggested authority at least, by comparison with the
      parents of other children he saw about him. Nowhere else, however, either
      then or in later years, did he see another home so filled from center to
      circumference with love, and tender gentleness of eye and word and deed.
      The perception that this environment was unique colored all his boyhood.
      It became a habit with him to set in contrast his own charmed existence
      against the unconsidered and uneven experiences of other children, and to
      ponder the meaning of the difference. As he grew up, the importance of
      this question expanded in his mind and took possession of it. He was
      consumed with the longing to make some effective protest against the
      peevish folly with which humanity mismanaged its brief innings of life.
      From the cradle to the grave the race swarmed stupidly along, elbowing and
      jostling in an aimless bustle, hot and ill-tempered through exertions
      which had no purpose; trampling down all weaker than themselves and
      cursing those who, in turn, had the strength to push them under; coming
      wearily at the end to the gate and the outer darkness of extinction, a
      futile and disappointed mob&mdash;having seen nothing, comprehended
      nothing, profited nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The progress of a generation across the span of life might be made so
      serene and well-ordered and fruitful an affair! What else had man to
      concern himself about than this one thing&mdash;that &ldquo;peace on earth, good
      will to men,&rdquo; should rule in his time? And how was it that this alone, of
      all possible problems, received from him no attention at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      The impulse toward a mission was discernible in the lad; it altogether
      dominated the young man. His parents, regarding him lovingly and yet with
      wise inquiry, were fascinated by what they saw. A sense of lofty
      responsibility in their trusteeship for this beneficent new force formed a
      fresh bond between them, which grew to absorb within itself all their
      other ties. They came to regard themselves in no other light than as the
      parents of Emanuel. To preserve him from vitiating and stunting
      suggestions; richly to nourish, yet with an anxious avoidance of surfeit,
      both the soul and the mind within him; to give him strength and means and
      single-hearted courage adequate to the task he yearned to undertake&mdash;they
      asked nothing better of life than this.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Oxford, he went abroad for a couple of years, having as a companion
      a young Fellow of Swithin&rsquo;s, a trifle older than himself, who shared his
      moral attitude if not his passionate aspirations. He saw many parts of the
      world, and scrutinized closely in each the working of those portions of
      the social mechanism which interested him. Returning with a mass of notes
      and a mind packed with impressions and theories, he set to work to write a
      big book. At the end of a year he produced instead a small volume, dealing
      with one little phase of the huge, complex theme he had at heart. It was a
      treatise on the relations between parents and children, and it received
      very favorable reviews indeed. University men felt that it was what they
      had had the foresight to expect from this serious and high-minded young
      fellow, who was lucky enough to have the means and leisure for ethical
      essay-writing. Evidently he was going in for that sort of thing, and they
      noted with approbation that he had been at great pains with his style.
      Much to Emanuel&rsquo;s surprise, only some three hundred copies of the work
      were sold; upon reflection, he saw that it was no part of his plan to sell
      books, and he forthwith distributed the remainder of the edition, and
      another edition as well, among the libraries of the Three Kingdoms. Within
      the next three years two other brochures went through much the same
      experiences. They treated respectively of primary education and of public
      amusements. Again the reviews were extremely cordial; again the men who
      had always predicted that Torr would do something regarded their prophetic
      intuition with refreshed complacency; again Emanuel drew considerable
      checks in favor of his publisher. What had been hinted at rather vaguely
      heretofore was now, however, announced with confidence in &ldquo;literary&rdquo;
       columns: these small volumes were merely chapters of a vast and
      comprehensive work to which the author had dedicated his life&mdash;the
      laborious exposition of a whole new philosophy of existence, to be as
      complete in its way as Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s noble survey of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after came the death of Emanuel&rsquo;s mother&mdash;an unlooked-for
      event which altered everything in the world to the bereaved couple left
      behind. They went away together in the following month, with a plan of a
      prolonged tour in the Orient, but came back to England after a few weeks&rsquo;
      absence, having found their proposed distraction intolerable. Lord Julius
      promptly invented for his own relief the device of taking over upon
      himself the drudgery of caring for his millions, which heretofore had been
      divided among a banker, a broker, a solicitor and two secretaries. Emanuel
      saw his way less directly, but at last he found the will to begin a
      tentative experiment with some of his theories of life on a Somersetshire
      farm which his father gave him. The work speedily engrossed him, and
      expanded under his hands. He became conscious of growth within himself as
      well. The conviction that life is a thing not to be written about, but to
      be lived, formulated itself in his mind, and he elaborated this new view
      in an argument which persuaded his father. The Somersetshire estates of
      the family, which had been bought by Lord Julius in 1859, when the duke
      and his son Porlock joined to set aside the entail, were placed now
      unreservedly at Emanuel&rsquo;s disposal. What he did with them is to be seen
      later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment, it was of the first importance that he should decide for
      himself the great question of celibacy v. marriage. The far-reaching
      projects which possessed his brain would, beyond doubt, be multiplied
      infinitely in value if precisely the right woman were brought in to share
      his enthusiasm and devotion. It was no whit less clear that they would
      dwindle into failure and collapse under the blight of the wrong woman. The
      dimensions of the risk so impressed him, as he studied them, that for more
      than two years he believed himself to be irrevocably committed to the cold
      middle course of bachelorhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, by a remarkable stroke of good fortune, he met, fell in love with
      and married the sister of Lord Rosbrin, a young Irish peer whom he had
      known at Oxford. No one has ever doubted, he least of all, that she was
      the right woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote no more books, in the years following this event, but gradually
      he became the cause of writing in others. A review article upon the
      character and aims of his experiment in Somersetshire, written in an
      appreciative spirit by an economist of position, attracted so much
      attention that the intrusion of curious strangers and inquisitive
      reporters threatened to be a nuisance. After this, his name was always
      mentioned as that of an authority, when sociological problems were
      discussed. There was even a certain flurry of inquiry for his books,
      though this did not turn out to have warranted the printing of the new
      popular edition. Sundry precepts in them became, however, the stock
      phrases of leader-writers. People of culture grew convinced that they were
      familiar with his works, and only a few months before the period at which
      we meet him, his university had conferred upon him an honorary D.C.L.,
      which gratified him more deeply than any other recognition his labors and
      attainments had ever received.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>hristian,
      observing his celebrated cousin by daylight for the first time, perceived
      the necessity of revising some of the previous night&rsquo;s impressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the illumination of the shaded lamp and the glowing bank of peat on
      the study hearth, Emanuel in his velvet jacket and slippered ease had
      seemed a delicately refined creature, of so ethereal a type that life for
      it outside the atmosphere of books, and of a library&rsquo;s thought and talk,
      would be unnatural, or even impossible. With his back to the afternoon
      sunshine, however, and with rough, light clothes suggesting fresh-air
      exercise, Emanuel was a different person.
    </p>
    <p>
      In stature he was a trifle taller than Christian; perhaps he was also
      something heavier, but what the newcomer noted most about the figure was
      the wiry vigor of muscular energy indicated in all its lines and
      movements. There was apparent no trace of any physical resemblance to his
      father, the massive Lord Julius, and Christian, as this fact occurred to
      him, remembered what he had heard about the race from which the mother had
      come. He could not say that Emanuel&rsquo;s face was like anything which he had
      thought of as distinctively Jewish. The forehead was both broad and
      prominent, and at the top, where early baldness exposed the conformation
      of the skull, there were curious sutural irregularities of surface which
      attracted attention. The rest of the face was indefinably distinguished in
      effect, but not so remarkable. Christian thought now that it was a more
      virile countenance than he had imagined it to be. Vague suggestions of the
      scholarly dreamer flitted through its expressions now and again, but it
      was still above all things the face of a man of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian had said to himself, in that crowded instant of analysis, that
      he had never seen any Jewish face which at all resembled this of his
      cousin&rsquo;s. Yet somewhere he had seen a face so like it!&mdash;the memory
      puzzled and absorbed his mind. The same crisping, silky black-brown hair;
      the same full line of brow and nose; the same wide-open dark eyes,
      intently comprehending in their steady gaze&mdash;how strangely familiar
      they were to him! He saw them again in his mind&rsquo;s eye, and they had the
      same shadow-casting background of sunlight&mdash;only as he looked at the
      mental picture, this sunlight was fiercer and hotter, and there was a
      golden, hazy distance of purple-blue sea. Suddenly he laughed aloud, and
      his brain was alive with recollections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never recognized you last night,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Is it not strange that
      I should have been so blind? But seeing you in the sunlight&mdash;ah, I
      remember you well enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel smiled too, a little awkwardly. &ldquo;Of course I was not making any
      secret of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It would have come up naturally, sooner or later,
      in the course of talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Christian had turned to the lady, and was speaking with gay animation.
      &ldquo;He it is whom I have so often thought of, for years now, as the
      &lsquo;mysterious stranger&rsquo; of my poor little romance. How long is it ago? Oh,
      ten years perhaps, since I saw him first. It was at Toulon, and I was
      walking along the quai in the late afternoon, and he stopped me to ask
      some question, and we fell to walking together and talking&mdash;at first
      about the old town, then of myself, because he wished it so. A long time
      passed, and lo! I saw him again. This time he came into Salvator&rsquo;s little
      shop at Cannes&mdash;it was in the Rue d&rsquo;Oran&mdash;and I was alone, and
      we talked again&mdash;it seems to me for more than an hour. And I wondered
      always who he could be&mdash;because he made me feel that he had friendly
      thoughts about me. And then, once more&mdash;it was a year ago last summer&mdash;he
      met me again, and came and sat beside me on a seat in the Jardin Public,
      at Nice. It must have been in June, for the season was ended, and it
      surprised me that he should be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I know all about it,&rdquo; put in Kathleen. &ldquo;He told me of his seeing
      you, and what he thought of you, almost as soon as your back was turned.
      But at that time, of course&mdash;things hadn&rsquo;t happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but he wanted to be kind to me, even then,&rdquo; the young man broke
      forth, with a glow in his eyes. &ldquo;I felt that in his tone, the very first
      time, when I was the young boy at school. Oh, I puzzled my brain very
      often about this young English gentleman who liked to talk to me. And here
      is a curious thing, that when the Credit Lyonnais gave me my summons to
      come to England, it was of him that I thought first of all, and wondered
      if he had not some part in it. And then I was so dull&mdash;I come to his
      own house, and sit at his own table with him as my cousin, and do not know
      him at all! It is true that he had no beard then&mdash;but none the less I
      am ashamed.&rdquo; He spread his hands out and smiled a deprecatory gesture at
      them both as he added: &ldquo;But then everything has been upside down in my
      mind since I came to England. It has been as if I were going up the side
      of a straight cliff in a funicular railway&mdash;my heart throbbing in
      terror, my brain whirling&mdash;afraid to look down, or out, or to realize
      where I was. But to-day I am happily at the end of the journey, and the
      good safe ground is well under my feet&mdash;and so I am not confused any
      more, but only very, very glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elder couple exchanged a frankly delighted smile over the enthusiast&rsquo;s
      head. &ldquo;You take him for a stroll about the place,&rdquo; said the wife. &ldquo;Perhaps
      I will come and find you, later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In obedience to the suggestion, the two men turned, and went off together
      across the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel began speaking at once. &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has given me a
      rough outline of what you have seen and heard. In the nature of things, it
      could not all be pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have quite forgotten the unhappy parts,&rdquo; the young man declared. &ldquo;I
      resolved to do that; it would be folly to remember them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have their uses, though,&rdquo; persisted the other. &ldquo;I wanted you to
      start out with just that impression of the family&rsquo;s seamy side. We have an
      immense deal to make up to the people about us, and to humanity in
      general, have we Torrs. It seemed to me that you could not realize this
      too early in your experience here. What impressions did Caermere itself
      make upon you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian hesitated a little, to give form to his thoughts. &ldquo;I am
      imagining it in my mind,&rdquo; he said at last, slowly, and with extended hands
      to shape his meaning to the eye, &ldquo;as a huge canvas, one of the very
      biggest. As it happens, there is an unpleasant picture on it now, but that
      can be wiped out, covered over, and then on the vast blank surface a new
      and splendid picture may be painted&mdash;if I have the skill to do it.&rdquo;
       He paused, as his companion nodded comprehension of the figure, and then
      added abruptly: &ldquo;I have not put the question direct before&mdash;but it is
      really the case that I am to succeed my grandfather&mdash;to be duke of
      Glastonbury, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Emanuel, gravely. &ldquo;That is the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Julius told me to ask you everything,&rdquo; Christian went on in defense
      of his curiosity. &ldquo;But, grand Dieu! there is so much to ask! Shall I be a
      rich man, also? There are dukes in France who can scarcely give a dinner
      to a friend&mdash;and in Italy who are often in doubt about even their own
      dinners. I understand that English dukes are different&mdash;but it has
      been said to me that my grandfather, for example, is not a rich man. He
      would be rich, no doubt, in some other station, but as a duke he is poor.
      Shall I also be poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel smiled, more, it seemed, to himself than for the benefit of the
      young man. With amusing deliberation he took from his pocket a little
      oblong book with flexible covers. &ldquo;Have you ever owned a checkbook?&rdquo; he
      asked drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is yours. It came from London this morning. I have written
      here on the back of the first check, on the part that remains in the book,
      these figures. They show what the bank holds at your disposal at the
      present moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian took the book, and stared with awe at the figures indicated.
      &ldquo;Three thousand pounds! That is to say, seventy-five thousand francs! But&mdash;I
      do not understand. What portion is this of my entire fortune? There is
      more besides&mdash;to come at some future period&mdash;n&rsquo;est ce pas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sum itself had seemed at first glance to be of bewildering dimensions.
      Soberer second thoughts, however, told him that he had been lifted into a
      social stratum where such an amount might easily come and go a number of
      times during one&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Emanuel began, hesitating in turn over his phrases, &ldquo;strictly
      speaking, you have no fortune at all. This money has been placed to your
      credit by my father&mdash;or if you like, by us both&mdash;to put you in a
      position of independence for the time being. You are quite free to spend
      it as you like. But&mdash;this is a somewhat delicate matter to explain&mdash;but
      we look to you in turn to be more or less guided by us in, say, your mode
      of life, your choice of associates and&mdash;and so on. Don&rsquo;t think that
      we wish in the least to hamper your individual freedom. I am sure you will
      feel that that is not our way. But we have formed very high hopes indeed
      for your career and&mdash;how shall I make you understand?&mdash;it rests
      a good deal with us to say how far the realization of these hopes warrants
      us in going on. That isn&rsquo;t plain to you, I see. Well, to put it frankly,
      you have nothing of your own, but we turn our money over to you because we
      believe in you. If unhappily&mdash;let us suppose the very improbable case&mdash;we
      should find ourselves no longer believing in you, why then we should feel
      free to reconsider our financial responsibilities towards you. That is
      stating it very baldly&mdash;not at all as I should like to have put it&mdash;but
      it gives you the essence of the situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had paused, and Christian regarded him with a troubled face. &ldquo;Then if
      you come not to like me, or if I make mistakes, you take everything away
      from me again? I have never heard of a system like that. It seems to place
      me in a very strange position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth&rsquo;s mobile countenance expressed such wistful dejection, as he
      faltered out these words, that Emanuel hastened to reassure him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he urged, putting a brotherly hand on his shoulder, &ldquo;it is the
      fault entirely of the way I explained it. No one will ever take anything
      away from you. In all human probability you will live and die a wealthy
      and powerful nobleman&mdash;and perhaps something a good deal more than
      that. But let me show you the situation in another way. You have seen your
      grandfather&mdash;so I need say little about him. When he had reached the
      age of fifty or thereabouts he had come to the end of his resources. Since
      the estates were entailed, nothing could be sold or mortgaged, and debts
      of all sorts were crowding in upon him and his eldest son, Lord Porlock.
      They were at their wits&rsquo; end to keep going at all; Porlock could not hold
      his head up in London, much less marry, as he was expected to do. If it
      had not been for the invention of life insurance, they could hardly have
      found money to live from week to week. That was in 1858 or &rsquo;9, when
      I was two or three years old. It was then that my father adopted his
      policy toward the older branch of the family. As you perhaps know, he was
      a very rich man. He came forward at this juncture, and saved the duke and
      his household from ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was very noble of him. It is what I should have thought he would
      do,&rdquo; interposed Christian. They had begun walking again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know that noble is quite the word,&rdquo; said Emanuel. &ldquo;The
      element of generosity was not very conspicuous in the transaction. The
      truth is that the duke and his son were not people that one could be
      generous to. They had to be bound to a hard-and-fast bargain. They agreed
      between them to break the entail, so that all the estates could be dealt
      with as was deemed best, and bound themselves to sell or mortgage nothing
      except to my father, unless with his consent. He on his side settled
      seventy thousand pounds on Porlock and his heirs, thus enabling him to
      marry, and he not only purchased from the duke the Somerset properties, of
      which this is a part, but he bought up his debts at the sacrifice of a
      good many thousands of pounds, so that in practice he became his brother&rsquo;s
      only creditor. No doubt there <i>was</i> generosity in that&mdash;since he
      cut down the rate of interest to something almost nominal by comparison
      with the usury that had been going on&mdash;but his motive was practical
      enough. It was to get complete financial mastery of the family estates.
      Nearly forty years have passed since he began; to-day he holds mortgages
      on practically every acre. If it were not for the mine near Coalbrook,
      which latterly yields the duke a certain surplus over the outlay at
      Caermere, my father would probably own it all outright. Well, you have
      followed it so far, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian thoughtfully nodded his head. &ldquo;These are not affairs that I have
      been brought up to understand,&rdquo; he commented, &ldquo;but I think I comprehend.
      Only this&mdash;you speak of your father&rsquo;s adopted policy; that means he
      has a purpose&mdash;an aim. The lady at the castle&mdash;Lady Cressage&mdash;spoke
      to me about this, and I wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, you met her,&rdquo; interposed
    </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel. &ldquo;I am not sure she was the best fitted to expound our policy to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she was very sympathetic,&rdquo; the young man hastened to insist. &ldquo;She had
      the warmest praises for both you and your father. And I could not but feel
      she wished me well, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel made no immediate reply, but walked slowly along, revolving silent
      thoughts, with a far-away, deliberative look in his eyes. When he spoke at
      last, it was to revert with abruptness to the earlier topic. &ldquo;The policy,
      as we are calling it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;can be put in a nutshell. We take that
      kind of pride in the family which impels us to resolve that, if we cannot
      induce it to do great things, we will at least prevent it doing base
      things. The position which your grandfather inherited was one of
      remarkable opportunities, and also of exceptional responsibilities. He was
      unfit to do anything with the opportunities, and as for the
      responsibilities, he regarded them with only ignorant contempt. His
      immediate heirs were very little better. It became a problem with us,
      therefore, how best to limit their power for harm. Money was the one force
      they could understand and respect, and we have used it accordingly. I say
      &lsquo;we&rsquo; because as the situation has gradually developed itself, it is hard
      to say which part of it is my father&rsquo;s and which mine&mdash;and still more
      impossible to imagine what either of us would have done independently of
      my mother. I will tell you more about her sometime. It was she, of course,
      who brought the money to us, but she brought much else besides. However,
      we will not enter upon that at the moment. Well, suddenly, last summer,
      the deaths changed everything. Up to that time, what we had been doing had
      had, so to speak, only a negative purpose. We had been keeping unfit
      people from parading their unfitness in too scandalously public a fashion.
      But all at once the possibility of doing something positive&mdash;something
      which might be very fine indeed&mdash;was opened up before us. As you know
      now, we were aware of your existence, but there were inquiries to be made
      as to&mdash;well, as to the formal validity of your claim. After that,
      there was some slight delay in tracing your whereabouts&mdash;but now you
      are here, at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I am here, at last!&rdquo; Christian repeated softly. He looked up into the
      sky; somewhere from the blue an invisible lark filled the air with its
      bubbling song. He drew a long breath of amazed content, then turned to his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That men like you and your father should be making plans and sacrifices
      for one like myself,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;it is hard for me to realize it.
      There is nothing for me to say but this&mdash;that I will spare no thought
      or labor to be what you want me to be. And you will make it all clear to
      me, will you not? in every detail what it is I am to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hardly to that length,&rdquo; said Emanuel. He smiled once more&mdash;that
      grave, sweet, introspective smile of his, which suggested humor as little
      as it did flippancy&mdash;and spoke more freely, as if conscious that the
      irksome part of his task lay behind him. &ldquo;We dream a great dream of you,
      but it would be folly to attempt to dictate to you at every stage of its
      realization. That would do you more harm than good, and it would be unfair
      to both parties, into the bargain. No, what I desire is to show you the
      practical workings of a system, and to fill you with the principles and
      spirit of that system. I think it will interest you deeply, and I hope you
      will see your way to making it, in its essentials at least, your own. It
      has taken me many years to build it up, and I can&rsquo;t pretend to suppose
      that you will grasp it in a week or a year. But you will see at least the
      aim I have in view, and you will get a notion of how I progress toward it.
      I shall be satisfied, for the time being, merely to commend it to your
      judgment as the aim which you might do well to set before you. It occurs
      to me to ask you: have you decided opinions in politics?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian shrugged his shoulders diffidently. &ldquo;In France my friends were
      of many parties, but since I thought never of myself as a Frenchman, I did
      not take sides with any of them. My brother Salvator is very advanced
      indeed; he is a Free Mason, and his friends are Carbonari in Italy and
      Socialists in France. But to me, these things had not much meaning. I said
      always to myself that I was English, and I read journals from London when
      I could, to learn about English parties. But it was not easy to learn. I
      stood in the streets often at Cannes in the early spring to see Mr.
      Gladstone when he passed, and to take off my hat to him, because I read
      that he was the greatest Englishman. But then I talked with English people
      on the Riviera about him, and they all cursed and ridiculed him, and told
      me that in England no respectable people would so much as speak to him. So
      it is very hard to know the truth&mdash;when you are born and bred in
      another country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even those who are born here do not invariably agree upon definitions of
      the truth,&rdquo; commented Emanuel. &ldquo;But I was not speaking of parties or
      politicians, so called. Politics, in its bigger sense, means the
      housekeeping of humanity&mdash;the whole mass of interests that the
      individuals of the human race have in common. But I don&rsquo;t want to
      generalize to you. Let us stop here for a few minutes; I have brought you
      to this point that you may get the view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their leisurely stroll through pastures and meadows, and latterly across a
      strip of grassy common dotted with sheep, had brought them by a gradual
      ascent to the summit of a knoll, crowned by a group of picturesquely
      gnarled and twisted old trees, the boughs of which were all pointed
      backward in the direction whence the men had come. Christian, coming to
      the ridge and halting, confronted the unexpected breeze, steady and
      sustained as an ocean swell, which he could hear murmuring through the
      land-ward bent branches overhead. In front of him, at the distance of a
      stone&rsquo;s throw, the sloping heath abruptly ended in what for the instant he
      supposed was the sky-line&mdash;and then saw to be a vast glittering
      expanse of water, stretching off to an illimitable horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the sea!&rdquo; he cried out, in surprised delight. &ldquo;I had never dreamed
      that we were near it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could distinguish now the faint intermittent rustle of the waves on the
      hidden beach far below. Perhaps a mile out the profile of a craft under
      full sail shone magically white in the sunlight. He knew it to be a yacht,
      and began watching it with an intuitive appreciation of its beauty of line
      and carriage. Then in a sudden impulse he swung around and faced his
      companion. &ldquo;I do not like to look at it,&rdquo; he broke out nervously. &ldquo;I am
      afraid to see the ghosts of those cousins who were drowned&mdash;killed to
      make room for me. Where their yacht went down on the rocks&mdash;was that
      close by here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least sixty miles away&mdash;in that direction,&rdquo; and Emanuel gave an
      indifferent nod towards the west. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t encourage ghosts of any
      sort, if I were you, but theirs would be least of all worth while. I
      wanted you to look about you from here&mdash;not specially seaward, but in
      all directions. There is a small village at the water&rsquo;s edge, almost
      directly under our feet, which can&rsquo;t be seen from above&mdash;we will get
      round to it, perhaps to-morrow&mdash;but look in other directions. As far
      as you can see along the coast to right and left&mdash;and inland, too&mdash;the
      system I spoke of is in operation. It is all my land. Get the scope of it
      into your mind. Roughly speaking, you can see over some nine or ten
      thousand acres. Imagine that multiplied by seven or eight, and you will
      have, an idea of the territory that your grandfather still owns&mdash;at
      least nominally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian kept a rapt gaze upon the prospect, and strove in silence to
      grasp the meaning of the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the land that you see before you,&rdquo; Emanuel went on, &ldquo;in one capacity
      or another, nearly two thousand human beings have homes. On your
      grandfather&rsquo;s estates there must be nearly if not quite ten times that
      number. Think what this means. You will be in a position to affect the
      prosperity, the happiness, the well-being, body and soul, of fifteen or
      twenty thousand people. It is a little nation&mdash;a small kingdom&mdash;of
      which you will be the head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man turned slowly and forced himself to look out upon the deep,
      but still said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This position you may make much of, or little, or worse than nothing at
      all,&rdquo; the other continued. &ldquo;It is a simple enough matter to put the work
      and the responsibility upon other shoulders, if you choose to do it. Many
      very respectable men born to such positions do wash their hands of the
      worry and labor in just that fashion. They lead idle lives, they amuse
      themselves, they take all that is yielded to them and give nothing in
      return&mdash;and because they avoid open grossness and scandal their
      behavior attracts no particular attention. In fact, it is quite taken for
      granted that they have done the natural thing. Being born to leisure, why
      should they toil? Possessing the title to wealth and dominion and the
      deference of those about them, why should they be expected to go to work
      and earn these things which they already own? That is the public view.
      Mine is very different. I hold that a man who has been born to a position
      of power among his fellows, and neglects the duties of that position while
      he accepts its rewards, is disgraced. It is as dishonest as any action for
      which less fortunate persons go to prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is my feeling, also,&rdquo; said Christian in low, earnest tones.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all true&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, the &lsquo;But,&rsquo;&rdquo; commented Emanuel, with his perceptive smile. &ldquo;Now
      let me explain to you that I have met this &lsquo;But,&rsquo; and done battle with it,
      and put it under my feet. I began planning for this struggle when I was
      very young. All the good people I knew admitted frankly the evils I speak
      of; they saw them quite clearly, and talked with eloquence and fine
      feeling about them, and at the finish they said &lsquo;But!&rsquo;&mdash;and changed
      the subject, and everything went on as before. It became apparent to me
      that this eternal &lsquo;But&rsquo; is the enemy of the human race. There it stood
      forever in the path, blocking every attempt of benevolent and right-minded
      people to advance in real progress. So I said: at least one life shall be
      given to the task of proving that there need be no &lsquo;But.&rsquo; I have been
      working here now for years, upon lines which were carefully thought out
      during other years of preparation. The results are in most respects better
      than I could have expected; they are certainly many-fold better than any
      one who had not my faith could have believed possible. Sundry limitations
      in the system I have, no doubt, discovered. Some things which seemed
      axiomatic on paper do not work themselves out the same way in practice&mdash;but
      as a whole the system is recognized now as having justified itself. There
      was an article in the &lsquo;Fortnightly&rsquo; on it last November which I will give
      you to read. I have written some chapters upon certain phases of it,
      myself, which you might also look at. But the principal thing is that you
      should see the system itself in full operation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am eager to begin,&rdquo; declared the young man, with fervor.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had turned by tacit consent, and were sauntering back again over the
      short, soft grass of the heath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel paused and picked from a furze-bush a belated spray of bright
      yellow blossoms. As he continued his walk, he pulled one of these flowers
      to pieces, and attentively examined the fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gather that you are much interested in flowers,&rdquo; said Christian, to
      make conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed briefly, as he threw the stuff aside, then sighed a
      little. &ldquo;Too much so,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I wish I had the courage to give it
      up altogether. It murders my work. I spend sometimes whole hours in my
      greenhouses when I ought to be doing other things. The worst of it is that
      I realize perfectly the criminal waste of time&mdash;and still I persist
      in it. There is something quite mysterious in plants&mdash;especially if
      you have grown them yourself. You can go and stand among them by the hour,
      and look from one to another, with your mind entirely closed to thoughts
      of any description. I used to assume that this mental rest had a
      recuperative value, but as I get older I suspect that it is a kind of
      lethargy instead&mdash;a mere blankness that can grow upon one. I find
      myself, for example, going incessantly to see certain pans of my own
      hybridized seedlings&mdash;and staring aimlessly at them till I get quite
      empty-headed. Now, I am too busy a man to be able to afford that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you get pleasure from it,&rdquo; expostulated Christian, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no right to think of our pleasure,&rdquo; Emanuel asserted with
      decision, &ldquo;while any duty remains unperformed. And rightly considered,
      duty <i>is</i> pleasure, the very highest and noblest pleasure. The
      trouble is that even while our minds quite recognize this, our senses play
      us tricks. For example, when I saw how much time I was wasting on flowers,
      I tried to turn the impulse into a useful channel. The blossoms of fruit
      trees, for instance; the growth and flowering and seeding processes of
      melons and broad-beans and potatoes and so on, are just as interesting and
      worthy of study, and they mean value to humanity into the bargain. So I
      said I would concentrate my attention upon them, instead&mdash;but there
      was some perverse element in me somewhere; I couldn&rsquo;t do it. The mere
      knowledge that these excellent vegetables were of practical utility threw
      me off altogether. They bored me&mdash;so I went shamefacedly back to the
      roses and fuchsias and dahlias.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have wonderful dahlias at Caermere,&rdquo; interposed Christian. &ldquo;I
      walked for a long time among them with Lady Cressage, and she told me all
      their names. Poor lady, she is very sad, in spite of the flowers. I&mdash;I
      think I should like to say it to you&mdash;I find myself very sorry for
      her. And&mdash;such a bewildering number of things are to be done for me&mdash;is
      there not something that can be done for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel walked slowly on in silence for some moments, regarding his
      companion&rsquo;s profile out of the corner of his eye, his own face showing
      signs of preoccupation meantime. When at last he spoke, the question
      seemed to have lost itself in convolution of his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Considering their northern exposure,&rdquo; he said meditatively, &ldquo;they grow an
      extraordinary amount of fruit at Caermere.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t the end of a
      fortnight Christian found himself able to confront the system, and even
      look it in the face, with a certain degree of mental composure. He was far
      from imagining that he had comprehended it all, but the thought of it no
      longer made his brain whirl by the magnitude of its scope, or frightened
      him by its daring. The implication that he was expected to do still more
      with it than Emanuel, its inventor and evangel, had done, possessed its
      terrors, no doubt, but one is not young for nothing. The buoyancy of
      youth, expanding genially amid these delightful surroundings, thrust these
      shadows off into the indefinite future, whenever they approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      This system need not detain us long, or unnerve us at all. Lord Julius had
      spoken figuratively of it as the Pursuit of Happiness; perhaps that
      remains its best definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like other systems, it was capable of explanation by means of formulas;
      but the most lucid and painstaking presentation of these could not hope to
      convey complete meaning to the mind. Stated in words, Emanuel&rsquo;s plan
      hardly appealed to the imagination. Save for a few innovations, not of
      primary importance, it proceeded by arguments entirely familiar to
      everybody, and which indeed none disputes. Most of its propositions were
      the commonplaces of human speech and thought. The value of purity, of
      cheerfulness, of loyalty, of mercy&mdash;this is not gainsaid by any one.
      The conception of duty as the mainspring of human action is very old
      indeed. For this reason, doubtless, Emanuel&rsquo;s efforts to expound his
      System by means of books had failed to rivet public attention. He could
      only insist afresh upon what was universally conceded, and Mr. Tupper
      before him had done enough of this to last several generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viewed in operation, however, the System was another matter. Our
      immemorial platitudes, once clothed in flesh and blood, informed with
      life, and set in motion under the sympathetic control of a master mind,
      became unrecognizable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel as a lad had thought much of the fact that he was of the blood of
      the Spinozas. When he learned Latin in his early boyhood, the task was
      sweetened and ennobled to his mind by the knowledge that it would bring
      him into communion with the actual words of the great man, his kinsman.
      Later, when he approached with veneration the study of these words, the
      discovery that they meant little or nothing to him was almost crushing in
      its effects. Eventually it dawned upon his brain that the philosopher&rsquo;s
      abstractions and speculations were as froth on the top of the water; the
      great fact was the man himself&mdash;the serene, lofty, beautiful
      character which shines out at us from its squalid setting like a flawless
      gem. To be like Spinoza, but to give his mind to the real rather than the
      unreal, shaped itself as the goal of his ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this period that he became impressed by the thought that he was
      also of the blood of the Torrs. On the one side the poor lens-grinder with
      the soul of an archangel; on the other the line of dull-browed,
      heavy-handed dukes, with a soul of any sort discoverable among them
      nowhere. Slowly the significance of the conjunction revealed itself to
      him. To take up the long-neglected burden of responsibilities and
      possibilities of the Torrs, with the courage and pure spirit of a Spinoza&mdash;there
      lay the duty of his life, plainly marked before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ensuing years of reading, travel and reflection gave him the frame, so to
      speak, in which to put this picture. He had from his childhood been
      greatly attracted by the glimpses which his father&rsquo;s library gave him of
      what is called the Mediaeval period. As he grew older, this taste became a
      passion. Where predilection ended and persuasion began, it would be hard
      to say, but when he had arrived at man&rsquo;s estate, and stood upon the
      threshold of his life-work, it was with the deeply rooted conviction that
      the feudal stage had offered mankind its greatest opportunities for
      happiness and the higher life. That the opportunities had been
      misunderstood, wasted, thrown away, proved nothing against the soundness
      of his theory. He had masses of statistics as to wages, rent-rolls,
      endowments and the like at his fingers&rsquo; ends, to show that even on its
      reverse side, the medieval shield was not so black as it was painted. As
      for the other side&mdash;it was the age of the cathedrals, of the Book of
      Kells, of the great mendicant orders, of the saintly and knightly ideals.
      It was in its flowering time that craftsmanship attained its highest
      point, and the great artisan guilds, proud of their talents and afraid of
      nothing but the reproach of work ill-done, gave the world its magnificent
      possessions among the applied arts. Sovereigns and princes vied with one
      another to do honor to the noblest forms of art, and to bow to the
      intellect of an Erasmus, who had not even the name of a father to bear.
      Class caste was the rule of the earth, yet the son of a peasant like
      Luther could force himself to the top, and compel emperors to listen to
      him, more readily then than now. The bishop-princes of feudal England were
      as often as not the sons of swineherds or starveling clerks, whereas now
      no such thing could conceivably happen to the hierarchy. Above all things,
      it was the age of human character. Men like Thomas More, with their
      bewildering circle of attainments and their extraordinary individual
      force, were familiar products. In a thousand other directions, Emanuel saw
      convincing proofs that mankind then and there had come closest to the
      possibilities of a golden age. True, it had wandered off miserably again,
      into all manner of blind lanes and morasses, until it floundered now in a
      veritable Dismal Swamp of individualism, menaced on the one side by the
      millionaire slave-hunter, on the other by the spectral anarchist, and
      still the fools in its ranks cried out ceaselessly for further progress.
      Oh, blind leaders of the blind!
    </p>
    <p>
      No. Emanuel saw clearly that humanity could right itself by retracing its
      steps, and going back to the scene of its mistaken choice of roads. It had
      taken the wrong turning when it forsook the path of coherent and
      interdependent organization&mdash;that marvelously intricate yet perfectly
      logical system called feudalism, in which everybody from king to serf had
      service to render and service to receive, and mutual duty was the law of
      the entire mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Christian heard much more than this, enough has been said to
      indicate the spirit in which Emanuel had embarked upon the realization of
      his plan. The results, as Christian wonderingly observed them, were
      remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The estate over which the System reigned was compact in shape, and enjoyed
      the advantage of natural boundaries, either of waste moorland or
      estuaries, which shut it off from the outside world, and simplified the
      problem of developing its individual character. In area it comprised
      nearly fifteen square miles, and upon it, as has been said, lived some two
      thousand people. About half of these were employed in, or dependent upon,
      the industrial occupations Emanuel had introduced; the others were more
      directly connected with the soil. Whether artisans or farmers, however,
      they lived almost without exception in some one of the six little villages
      on the property.
    </p>
    <p>
      In each of these hamlets there were conserved one or more old timbered
      houses; the newer cottages had been built, not in servile imitation of
      these, but after equally old models, no two quite alike. As the
      &ldquo;Fortnightly Review&rdquo; article said, if the System had done nothing else it
      had &ldquo;gathered for the instruction and delight of the intelligent observer
      almost a complete collection of examples of early English domestic
      architecture of the humbler sort.&rdquo; The numerous roads upon the estate were
      kept in perfect order, and were for the most part lined with trees; where
      they passed through the villages they were of great width, with broad
      expanses of turf, shaded by big oaks or elms, some of which had been moved
      from other spots only a few years before, to the admiring surprise of the
      neighborhood. Each village had a small church edifice of its own, quaintly
      towered and beautiful in form, and either possessing or simulating
      skillfully the graces of antiquity as well. Beside the church was a
      building presenting some one or another type of the tolsey-house of old
      English towns, devoted to the communal uses of the villagers. About the
      church and the tolsey was the public garden and common, with a playground
      with swings and bars for the children at the back&mdash;and there was no
      grave or tombstone in sight anywhere. A hospitable, ivy-clad, low-gabled
      inn, with its long side to the street, was a conspicuous feature on each
      village green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian retained a vivid recollection of entering one of these taverns
      with Emanuel, very early in his tour of observation. Above the broad, open
      door, as they went in, swung the cumbrous, brightly painted sign of &ldquo;The
      Torr Arms.&rdquo; Two or three laborers in corduroys were seated on benches at
      the table, with tankards before them; they dragged their heavily shod feet
      together on the sanded floor, and stood up, when they saw Emanuel,
      touching their hats with an air of affectionate humility as he smiled and
      nodded to them. There was a seemingly intelligent and capable landlady in
      the bar, who drew the two glasses of beer which Emanuel asked for, and
      answered cheerfully the questions he put to her. Two brightfaced young
      women, very neatly dressed, were seated sewing in this commodious bar, and
      they joined in the conversation which Emanuel raised. Christian gathered
      from what he heard and saw that his cousin took an active interest in the
      fortunes of this tavern and of both its inmates and its patrons, and that
      the interest and liking were warmly reciprocated. The discovery gave him a
      more genial conception of Emanuel&rsquo;s character than he had hitherto
      entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is one of my most satisfactory enterprises,&rdquo; Emanuel had said when
      they came out. &ldquo;We brew our own beer, as well as the few cordials which
      take the place of spirits, and I really feel sure it&rsquo;s the best beer
      obtainable in England. I am very proud of it&mdash;but I am proud of these
      taverns of ours too. That was one of the hardest problems to be solved&mdash;but
      the solution satisfies me better, perhaps, than anything else I have done.
      Nobody ever dreams of getting drunk in these &lsquo;pubs&rsquo; of ours. Nobody dreams
      of being ashamed to be seen going into them or coming out. The women and
      children enter them just as freely, if they have occasion to do so, as
      they would a dairy or grocer&rsquo;s shop. They are the village clubs, so to
      speak, and they are constantly open to the whole village, as much as the
      church or the tolsey. But here is one of my parsons. I want you to take
      note of him&mdash;and I will tell you about his part in the System
      afterward. He is as interesting a figure in it as my publican.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tall, fresh-faced, fair young man approached them as Emanuel spoke, and
      was presented to the stranger as Father William. Christian observed him
      narrowly, as he had been bidden, but beyond the fact that he was clad in a
      somewhat outlandish fashion, and seemed a merry-hearted fellow, there was
      nothing noteworthy in the impression he produced. He stood talking for a
      few minutes, and then, with affable adieux, passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is wholly my invention,&rdquo; commented Emanuel, as they resumed their
      walk. &ldquo;There is one of them in each of the six villages, and a seventh who
      has a kind of general function&mdash;and really I have been
      extraordinarily fortunate with them all. They come from my college at
      Oxford&mdash;Swithin&rsquo;s&mdash;and when you think that twenty years ago it
      was the most bigoted hole in England, the change is most miraculous. These
      young men fell in with my ideas like magic. I don&rsquo;t suppose you know much
      about the Church of England. Well, it drives with an extremely loose rein.
      You can do almost anything you like inside it, if you go about the thing
      decorously. I didn&rsquo;t even have the trouble with the bishop which might
      have been expected. These young men&mdash;my curates, we may call them&mdash;have
      among themselves a kind of guild or confraternity. They are called Father
      William, or Father Alfred; they wear the sort of habit you have seen; they
      are quite agreed upon an irreducible minimum of dogmatic theology, and an
      artistic elaboration of the ritual, and, above all, upon an active life
      consecrated to good works. They have their own central chapter-house,
      where they live when they choose and feel like enjoying one another&rsquo;s
      society, but each has his own village, for the moral and intellectual
      health of which he feels responsible. Without their constant and very
      capable oversight, the System would have a good many ragged edges, I&rsquo;m
      afraid. But what they do is wonderful. They have made a study of all the
      different temperaments and natures among the people. They know just how to
      smooth away possible friction here, to encourage dormant energy there, to
      keep the whole thing tight and clean and sound. They specially watch the
      development of the children, and make careful notes of their qualities and
      capacities. They decide which are to be fully educated, and which are to
      be taught only to read and do sums.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that I understand,&rdquo; put in Christian. &ldquo;Is not universal
      education a part of your plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel smiled indulgently. &ldquo;There was never grosser nonsense talked in
      this world,&rdquo; he said, with the placid air of one long since familiar with
      the highest truths, &ldquo;or more mischievous rubbish into the bargain, than
      this babble about universal education. The thing we call modern
      civilization is wrong at so many points that it is hard to say where it
      sins most, but often I think this is its worst offense. The race has gone
      fairly mad over this craze for stuffing unfit brains with encumbering and
      harmful twaddle. In the Middle Ages they knew better. The monks of a
      locality picked out the children whose minds would repay cultivation, and
      they taught these as much as it was useful for them to know. If the system
      was in honest operation, it mattered nothing whether these children
      belonged to the lord of the manor or the poorest peasant. Assume, for
      example, that there was a nobleman and one of his lowest dependents, and
      that each of them had a clever son and a dull one. The monks would take
      the two clever ones, and educate them side by side&mdash;and if in the end
      the base born boy had the finer mind of the two, and the stronger
      character, he would become the bishop or the abbot or the judge in
      preference to his noble school-fellow. On the other hand, the two dull
      boys were not wearied by schooling from which they could get no profit.
      The thick-headed young-noble, very often without even learning his
      alphabet, was put on a horse, and given a suit of armor and a sword; the
      heavy-witted young churl was given a leathern shirt and a pike or a bow,
      and bidden to follow behind that horse&rsquo;s tail&mdash;and off the two happy
      dunces went, to fulfill in a healthful and intelligent fashion their
      manifest destiny. Those were the rational days when human institutions
      were made to fit human beings&mdash;instead of this modern lunacy of
      either shaving down and mangling the human being, or else blowing him up
      like a bladder, to make him appear to fit the institutions. Of course, you
      must understand, I don&rsquo;t say that this medieval system worked uniformly,
      or perfectly, even at its best&mdash;and, of course, for a variety of
      reasons, it eventually failed to work altogether. But its principle, its
      spirit, was the right one&mdash;and it is only by getting back to it, and
      making another start with the light of experience to guide us this time,
      that we can achieve real progress. Fortunately, my parsons entered fully,
      and quite joyfully, into my feelings on this point. They couldn&rsquo;t have
      labored harder, or better, to make the System a success if it had been of
      their own invention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen English parsons often,&rdquo; said Christian, vaguely. &ldquo;They are
      always married, n&rsquo;est ce pas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;no!&rdquo; answered Emanuel, with impatient emphasis. &ldquo;That would
      never do here. It is difficult enough to find men fit to carry on the task
      we have undertaken. It would be asking too much of the miracle to expect
      also unique women who would bring help rather than confusion to such men.
      Oh, no&mdash;we take no risks of that sort. Celibacy is the very basis of
      their guild. It is very lucky that their own tastes run in that direction&mdash;because
      in any case it would have had to be insisted upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian wondered if he ought to put into words the comment which rose in
      his mind. &ldquo;But you, and your father,&rdquo; he ventured&mdash;&ldquo;you personally&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; interposed Emanuel, with a rapt softening of expression in face and
      tone, &ldquo;when women like my mother and my wife appear&mdash;that lifts us
      away from the earth and things earthly, altogether. But they are as rare
      as a great poem&mdash;or a comet. If they were plentiful there would be no
      need of any System. The human race would never have fallen into the mud.
      We should all be angels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a little pause he added: &ldquo;The woman question here has been a very
      hard nut to crack. We have made some progress with it&mdash;but it is
      still one of the embarrassments. Of course there are others. The restless
      young men who leave the estate, for example, and having made a failure of
      it elsewhere, come back to make mischief here: That is an awkward subject
      to deal with. The whole problem of our relations to outsiders is full of
      perplexities. To prevent intercourse with them is out of the question.
      They come and go as they like&mdash;and of course my own people are
      equally free. I can&rsquo;t see my way to any restrictions which wouldn&rsquo;t do
      more harm than good&mdash;if indeed they could be enforced at all. I have
      to rely entirely upon the good sense and good feeling of my people, to
      show them how much better off they are in every way than any other
      community they know of, and how important it is for them to keep
      themselves to themselves, and continue to benefit by their good fortune.
      If they fail to understand this, I am quite powerless to coerce them. And
      that is where the women give us trouble. It is the rarest thing for us to
      have any difficulty with the men. They comprehend their advantages, they
      take a warm interest in their work, and we have developed among them a
      really fine communal spirit. They are proud of the System, and fond of it,
      and I can trust them to defend it and stand by it. But this isn&rsquo;t true of
      all the women. You have always the depressing consciousness that there are
      treacherous malcontents among them, who smile to your face but are
      planning disturbance behind your back. It is not so much a matter of evil
      natures as of inferior brains. Let a soldier in a red coat come along, for
      example&mdash;an utterly ignorant and vulgar clown from heaven knows what
      gutter or pigsty&mdash;and we have girls here who would secretly value his
      knowledge of the world, and his advice upon things in general, above <i>mine!</i>
      How <i>can</i> you deal with that sort of mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian smiled drolly, and disclaimed responsibility with a playful
      outward gesture of his hands. &ldquo;It is not my subject,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it has to be faced,&rdquo; insisted Emanuel. &ldquo;My wife has devoted
      incredible labor and pains to it&mdash;and on the surface of things she
      has succeeded wonderfully. I say the surface, because that is the sinister
      peculiarity of the affair; you can never be sure what is underneath. When
      you go up to London, you must do as I have done since I was a youth: take
      a walk of a bright afternoon along Regent Street and Oxford Street, where
      the great millinery and drapers&rsquo; and jewelers&rsquo; shops are, and study the
      faces of the thousands of well-dressed and well-connected women whom you
      will see passing from one show-window to another. There will be many
      beautiful faces, and many more which are deeply interesting. But one note
      you will catch in them all&mdash;or at least in the vast majority&mdash;the
      note of furtiveness. Once you learn to recognize it you will find it
      everywhere&mdash;the suggestion of something hidden, something artfully
      wrapped up out of sight. God knows, I don&rsquo;t suggest they all have guilty
      secrets&mdash;or for that matter secrets of any sort. But they have the
      trained facial capacity for concealment; it is their commonest
      accomplishment; their mothers&rsquo; fingers have been busy kneading their
      features into this mask of pretense from their earliest girlhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you not find it also on the men&rsquo;s faces?&rdquo; demanded Christian, with
      a dissolving mental vision of sly masculine visages before him as he
      spoke. &ldquo;That is to say, when once you had learned to detect the male
      variation of the mask? And even if it is so, then is not the reason of it
      this&mdash;that men have long been their own masters, making their own
      laws, doing freely what they choose, and there is no one before whom they
      must dissemble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel had not the temperament which is attracted by contradiction. He
      listened to his cousin&rsquo;s eager words, seemed to ponder them for a space,
      and then began talking of something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those whom Emanuel called &ldquo;his people&rdquo; were for the most part descendants
      of families who had been on the soil for centuries&mdash;since before the
      Torrs came into possession of it. In a few cases, their stock had been
      transplanted from the Shropshire estates of the same house. Emanuel had
      discerned it to be an essential part of the System that its benefits
      should be reaped by those to whom his family had historic
      responsibilities. The reflection that the Torrs in Somerset only went back
      at the farthest to Henry VIII.&lsquo;s time, and became large landlords there so
      recently as Charles II.&lsquo;s reign, saddened him when he dwelt upon it. He
      would have given much to have been able to establish the System at
      Caermere instead, where the relations between lord and retainer had
      subsisted from the dawn of tribal history. He dwelt a good deal upon this
      aspect of the matter in his talks with Christian. &ldquo;If you take up the
      idea,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;you will have the enormous advantage of really
      ancient ties between you and your people. Here in Somerset we are,
      relatively speaking, new-comers&mdash;merely lucky bridegrooms or
      confiscating interlopers of a few generations&rsquo; standing. I have had to
      create my feudal spirit here out of whole cloth. But you at Caermere&mdash;you
      will find it ready-made to your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel had created much more besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The villages hummed with the exotic industries he had brought into being.
      The estate produced most of its raw material&mdash;food, wool, hides, peat
      for domestic fuel, stone in several varieties for building, and numerous
      products of the sea. It drew coal, wood and iron across the channel from
      the Caermere properties. The effort of the System had been from the outset
      to expand its self-sufficiency. Christian saw now the remarkable results
      of this effort on both sides. One village had its leather workers,
      beginning with the tanners at one end and finishing with the most skillful
      artificers&mdash;glovers, saddlers and shoemakers&mdash;at the other. A
      second village possessed its colony of builders&mdash;masons and
      carpenters alike&mdash;and with them guiding architects and designers of
      furniture and carving. Here also were the coopers, who served not only the
      brewery, but the butter-makers. These latter formed in turn a link with
      the great dairy establishment, which had for its flank the farming lands.
      The gardens, nurseries, orchards and long glasshouses were nearest to
      Emanuel&rsquo;s residence, and their workers made up the largest of the hamlets.
      This was in other senses the metropolis of the state, for here were the
      printing-press, the bindery, the chemical laboratory, the electric-light
      plant, the photographic and drawing departments, the clergy house and the
      estate office. The smallest of the villages was in the center of the stock
      farm, where scientific breeding and experimental acclimatization had
      attained results of which the staid &ldquo;Field&rdquo; spoke in almost excited terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to Christian&rsquo;s mind by far the most interesting village was that
      nestled on the sea-shore, under the protection of the cliffs. When he had
      once seen this place, his cousin found if difficult to get him away from
      it, or to enlist his attention for other branches of the System. There was
      a small but sufficient wharf here, to which colliers of a fair burden
      could have access; shelter was secured for the home-built fishing craft in
      the little harbor by means of a breakwater. The red-roofed, gray-stone
      cottages clustered along the winding roadway which climbed the cliff made
      a picture fascinating to the young man&rsquo;s eye, but his greater delight was
      in something not at first visible. Around a bend in the cove, out of sight
      of the village, was a factory for the manufacture of glass, and beyond
      this were pointed out to him other buildings, near the water&rsquo;s edge, which
      he was told were used for curing, pickling and otherwise preserving fish.
      &ldquo;We make our own glass for the gardens and forcing houses, &lsquo;and for all
      the dwellings on the estate,&rdquo; Emanuel had told him, &ldquo;and for another use
      as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The statement had not aroused his curiosity at the moment, but a little
      later, when he confronted the embodiment of its meaning, he murmured aloud
      in his astonishment. He found himself walking in a spacious corridor,
      beneath a roof of semi-opaque, greenish glass, and between walls that
      seemed of solid crystal, stretching onward as far as the eye could reach.
      A bar of sunlight, striking through aslant from somewhere outside, painted
      a central glowing prismatic patch of color, which reflected itself in
      countless wavering gleams of orange and purple all about him. A curious
      moving glitter, as of fountains noiselessly at play, traversed the upper
      surface of these glass walls, and flashed confusion at his first scrutiny.
      Then he gave a schoolboy&rsquo;s shout of joy and rushed forward to the nearest
      side. He was in a giant aquarium&mdash;and these were actual fishes of the
      sea swimming placidly before him! Even as he stared in bewildered
      pleasure, with his nose flattened against the glass, there lounged toward
      him, across the domed back of a king-crab, the biggest conger he had ever
      imagined to himself. He put up a hand instinctively to ward off the
      advance of the impassive eel&mdash;then laughed aloud for glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is worth all the rest!&rdquo; he cried to Emanuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, good idea, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;It was my wife who suggested
      it. We had started making our own glass&mdash;and really this was a most
      intelligent way of using it. In time I think it will be of great value,
      too. We have some clever men down here, from time to time, to study the
      specimens. I&rsquo;m sorry no one is here for the moment. I thought at first of
      building a residence for them, and putting it all at their disposal in a
      regular way as a kind of marine observatory, like that at Naples. But
      after all, it would hardly be fair to the system. My first duty is to my
      own people, and we&rsquo;ve got some young men of our own who are making good
      use of it. There are a hundred or more of these tanks, and we are fitting
      up electrical machinery to get automatic control of the water supply, and
      to regulate the temperature more exactly. But beyond the spectacle of the
      fishes themselves&mdash;our people make holiday excursions here every
      fortnight or so&mdash;and certain things we learn about food and
      fecundation and so on, I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s much to be said for the
      practical utility of this department. Further on you will see the oyster
      and mussel beds, and the lobsters and crabs. I attach much more importance
      to the experiments we are making out there. There seems almost no limit to
      what can be done in those fields, now that we have learned how to go to
      work. It is as simple a matter to rear lobsters as it is to rear
      chickens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is all wonderful!&rdquo; cried Christian, once more. &ldquo;But tell me&mdash;this
      costs a great sum of money. I am afraid to think how much. Is it your hope&mdash;shall
      you ever get a profit from it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel smiled. &ldquo;There is no question of profits,&rdquo; he explained, gently.
      &ldquo;The System as a whole supports itself&mdash;or rather is entirely capable
      of doing so. The capital that I have spent in putting the System upon its
      feet, so to speak, I count as nothing. It belonged to the people who had
      been with us all these centuries and I have merely restored it to them. In
      the eyes of the law it is all mine, and from that point of view I am a
      much richer man than I was before the System began. But in practice it
      belongs to all my people. I take enough to live as befits my station; each
      of the others has enough to maintain him in <i>his</i> station,
      comfortably and honorably. Whatever the surplus may be, that is devoted to
      the objects which we all have in common. You see it is simplicity itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is like my brother Salvator&rsquo;s doctrine,&rdquo; said Christian. &ldquo;It is
      socialism, is it not?&rdquo; Emanuel&rsquo;s fine brows drew together in an impatient
      frown. &ldquo;Please do not use that word,&rdquo; he said, with a shade of annoyance
      in his tone. &ldquo;The very sound of it affronts my ears. Nothing vexes me more
      than to have my work unthinkingly coupled with that monstrous imposture.
      If you will think of it, I am more opposed to what is called socialism
      than anybody else on earth. I have elaborated the one satisfactory system,
      on lines absolutely opposed to it. I furnish the best weapon for fighting
      and slaying that pernicious delusion that the whole world offers. So you
      see, I have a right to protest when people confuse me with my bitterest
      antagonist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon!&rdquo; said Christian, with humility. &ldquo;I am so badly informed upon all
      these matters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, you will understand them perfectly, all in good time,&rdquo; his
      cousin reassured him in a kindly way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian drew a furtive sigh as they moved along. To his fancy the large
      fishes in the tanks regarded him with a sympathetic eye.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t has done Emanuel
      a world of good to have you here,&rdquo; said Kathleen, on the morning of
      Christian&rsquo;s leave-taking. &ldquo;Of course it has been a delight to us both&mdash;but
      he has had a personal benefit from it, too. He works too hard. He carries
      such a burden of details about in his mind&mdash;by day and by night, for
      he sleeps badly and is forever dreaming of his work&mdash;that
      companionship with some new and attractive mind is of the greatest rest
      and help to him. And he is very fond of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian nodded gratified acknowledgment of the words and their spirit,
      with a glow in his dark eyes. In little more than an hour he would be on
      his way to London&mdash;that mighty, almost fabulous goal of his lifelong
      dreams. He was already dressed for the journey, in a traveling-suit of
      rough, fawn-colored cloth, and as he sat at ease in the breakfast-room
      with his cousin&rsquo;s wife, his glance wandered very often from her face to a
      pleased contemplation of these garments. They were what he individually
      liked best in the wonderful collection of clothes for which a fashionable
      tailor had come from London to measure him, and which were this moment
      being packed by the man up-stairs in bags and portmanteaus equally new.
      The tweeds enabled him to feel more like an Englishman than he had
      succeeded in doing before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled diffidently at her. &ldquo;I am so excited about going,&rdquo; he said, his
      voice wavering between exuberance and appeal&mdash;&ldquo;and yet I ought to be
      thinking of nothing but my sorrow in leaving you dear people. But that
      will come to me soon enough&mdash;in a storm of homesickness&mdash;when
      once I find myself really alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll not deny we expect a <i>little</i> homesickness,&rdquo; she replied to
      him, cheerfully&mdash;&ldquo;but it must not be enough to at all take the edge
      off your spirits. Oh, you&rsquo;ll be vastly entertained and interested by all
      you see and hear. Young Lord Lingfield&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be seeing him to-night
      at dinner&mdash;he will be greatly pleased to take you about, and properly
      introduce you; He will do it better than any other we can think of. He is
      not by any means an intellectual gladiator, but he is good-looking and
      amiable and he goes everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my relation, too, I think Emanuel said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s work it out&mdash;his grandfather&rsquo;s sister was your grandmother.
      Yes, that is it. She was the Lady Clarissa Poynes, the sister of the old
      earl of Chobham, who used to wear the blue coat and brass buttons to the
      end of his days. So she would be the aunt of the present earl, and the
      grand-aunt of young Lingfield. You stand in exactly the same relationship
      to Lord Lingfield that you would to a son of Emanuel&rsquo;s&mdash;if he had
      one, poor man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian had long since become sensible of the pathos which colored these
      references to the childlessness of the house. A tender instinct impelled
      him to hasten a diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how strange it is!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;They are as close to me, these people,
      in blood as Emanuel is&mdash;and yet I care nothing for them whatever. I
      shall meet them, and know them, and not feel that I am bound to them at
      all&mdash;whereas Emanuel is like a brother to me, whom I have been with
      and loved all my life. And you,&rdquo; he added, with a smile in his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;you
      are more than any sister to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, let me talk to you like a sister,&rdquo; she rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought he had not seen her before in precisely the mood which was
      discernible in her face and tone this morning. Outwardly she was as gay
      and light-hearted as ever, and certainly she had not seemed on any
      previous day to come so near being beautiful as well. The sense of sheer
      pleasure in being where she was, in listening to her and looking&rsquo; at her,
      and holding her affectionately bright attention for his own thoughts, was
      peculiarly strong in him to-day. But there was also the consciousness of a
      new gravity in her attitude toward him&mdash;a kind of yearning
      apprehension of dangers threatening him. He saw again in her eyes when she
      looked at him that likeness to his mother&rsquo;s glance&mdash;a wistfully sad
      glance as he most often recalled it. And yet Kathleen smiled merrily with
      it all, when occasion required.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are entering upon the great experience now,&rdquo; she said to him: &ldquo;I
      think it was very wise of Emanuel to show you first what we may call his
      ideal state of society. By all the rules, it ought to help you to
      understand in the right way what you will see of the society which&mdash;well,
      which isn&rsquo;t in an ideal state. But there are certain things which get to
      be understood, not so much by brains, as by years. That is to say, the
      very cleverest youth may not be able to see, in this one respect, what is
      plain enough to most dull persons at forty. Emanuel tells me that he has
      talked with you about women in general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not like them very much,&rdquo; said Christian, laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She twisted the corners of her mouth in a droll little grimace, which
      seemed to express approval of his mirth, and something more besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He takes them with tremendous seriousness,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;That is his
      way with everything. He makes all sorts of classifications&mdash;the
      bigger they are and the more complicated the better he likes them&mdash;and
      then he treats each one as a problem, and he worries at it with all his
      energy until he works out a satisfactory solution. It is only in that
      sense that he has a grievance against women. He has proceeded upon the
      theory that the sex is a unit, for philosophical purposes at least, and
      that he ought to be able to get at the rules which govern its actions. But
      we continue to baffle him,&rdquo; she added, again with the playful curl of the
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&mdash;you are not in the problem,&rdquo; protested Christian. &ldquo;For you
      and his mother he has only the veneration one gives to one&rsquo;s favorite
      saints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His mother was a great woman,&rdquo; said Kathleen, serious once more. &ldquo;I never
      saw her, but she is my patron saint, as you put it, quite as much as his.
      I never permit myself to doubt that we should have loved each other deeply&mdash;and
      it is the sweetest thing any one can think of me, or say to me&mdash;to
      link us together. But even the saints have their specialties&mdash;and
      that implies limitations. I have a notion that Emanuel&rsquo;s mother did not
      know many women, and so fell into a way of generalizing about them.
      Emanuel has that same tendency. I, who work among them daily, and make it
      my business to be teacher and mistress and mother and sister to some five
      hundred of them, young and old, foolish and wise&mdash;I come to believe
      that these generalizations are entirely mistaken. If a woman is brought up
      like a man, and circumstanced precisely like a man, and knows nothing of
      any conventions save those which control a man&mdash;why, then you can&rsquo;t
      tell the difference between her opinions and actions and those of her
      brother. But you never get the chance to view a woman under those
      conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But here we shall see them!&rdquo; cried Christian, with premature enthusiasm.
      &ldquo;You will change all that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she answered abruptly. &ldquo;It is not being tried&mdash;it
      is not desirable. What I am doing proceeds quite on orthodox lines. We
      make a point of developing them in the way of usefulness&mdash;material
      usefulness, I mean. We teach them the useful accomplishments&mdash;spinning,
      weaving, sewing, dairy and poultry work, and above all things good
      cooking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I can well believe,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I have never eaten so many good
      dishes in my life as here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I <i>have</i> a talent in that direction,&rdquo; she assented. &ldquo;And I am
      prouder of it because it represents a triumph over my ancestral
      prejudices. You will get nothing good to eat in Ireland. The Irish have
      never respected food as a proper subject for serious human thought. It is
      the rarest thing to hear them mention it. There may be some fine spiritual
      quality in that&mdash;but at all events we cook well here, and I have
      worked a complete revolution in that respect on the estate. There are
      certainly no such cooks and housekeepers anywhere else in England as my
      women. But you see what I mean. There is no effort to take women away from
      the work they have always been doing, but only to make them do it better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that in itself is very much,&rdquo; urged Christian. Somehow he had the
      feeling that he was defending the System against a critic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;And of course we do something more than
      that. In a good many cases, when it was not inconvenient, I have put young
      girls of aptitude forward to learn designing and other arts. Some of them
      have made me some very tolerable tapestry, and a few of them are as
      intelligent and valuable in the greenhouses as our best men. In the matter
      of music they really beat them. Emanuel insists on a choir of glee singers
      in each village&mdash;and at Christmas time we have a competition of
      &lsquo;waits&rsquo; which will be worth your while coming to hear. For my part, I have
      a string orchestra of girls that I should not be ashamed to have play in
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word seemed to bring them back, &ldquo;You were going to speak to me,&rdquo;
       Christian ventured, &ldquo;about London. One thing&mdash;I shall see you there
      often, shall I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slowly shook her head. &ldquo;No, we have outgrown London, I&rsquo;m afraid. It
      can be proved, I believe, that it is the biggest town in the world&mdash;but
      to us it is too small for comfort. It is now more than a year since we
      have been up at all. Why should we go? We have the National Gallery by
      heart, and the year&rsquo;s pictures are rather distressing than otherwise. The
      theaters are intellectually beneath notice. There is the opera of course,
      and the concerts, but the people annoy us by talking loudly, and besides,
      we have our own music, and occasionally we bring down a Paderewski or a
      Sarasate for our people to hear. At the houses where we would naturally
      go, the women talk about matters of which I know absolutely nothing, and
      Emanuel either quarrels with the men about what they call their politics,
      or chokes silently with rage and disgust. And then the spectacle of the
      people in the streets&mdash;the poor of London!&mdash;that fairly sickens
      our hearts. We have no joy of going at all. Occasionally we have guests
      down here, but it is not a very happy time they have of it. Everything is
      so strange to them that they are confused, and walk about with constraint,
      as if they were being shown around an asylum. So it happens that I see
      very few women of my own class&mdash;and really know less about them than
      most people. And yet,&rdquo; she added, with a twinkle in her eye, &ldquo;so naturally
      audacious a race are the Irish&mdash;it is precisely about ladies in
      London society that I am going to read you a lecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian drew up his feet, and assumed an air of delighted anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all, you are six and twenty, and you will be thinking of
      marrying. What is more, you are what is called a great match, and for
      every thought that you give to the subject of a wife, others will give ten
      thousand to the subject of you as a possible husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked into her kindly eyes with a sustained glance of
      awakening thought. This dazzling and princely position which she had thus
      outlined&mdash;sure enough, it was his! How extraordinary that this had
      not suggested itself to him before! Or had the perception of it not really
      lain dormant in his consciousness all the while? This question propounded
      itself to a mind which was engrossed in something else&mdash;for of a
      sudden there rose upon the blank background of his thoughts the luminous
      face of a lady, beautiful, distinguished, exquisitely sensitized, and as
      by the trick of a dream she first wore a large garden hat, and then was
      bare-headed, her fair hair gathered loosely back into a careless knot. The
      mental picture expanded, to show the full length of her queenly figure as
      she descended a broad staircase, with one lovely hand like a lily against
      the oak of the rail. Then it contracted, and underwent a strange
      metamorphosis, for it was another face which he saw, a pale, earnest,
      clever face, and instead of the great stairway, there was the laced
      tawdriness of a French railway compartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a start, and a backward movement of the head, he was free of
      dreamland, and blushingly conscious of having stared his cousin out of
      countenance. He laughed with awkward embarrassment. &ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose it
      is true&mdash;what you say,&rdquo; he remarked, stumblingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had perhaps some clew to the character of his reverie. She smiled in a
      gently quizzical way, but went on soberly enough. &ldquo;The thing of all
      things,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is to be clearly and profoundly convinced in your own
      mind that your marriage will be the most important event of your life&mdash;that
      it will indeed affect, for good or for bad, every conceivable element of
      your life. You have the kind of temperament which would be peculiarly
      susceptible to such intimate influences. There are great numbers of men&mdash;the
      vast majority&mdash;to whom it does not matter so much. They accommodate
      themselves to their burdens, and shuffle along somehow, with the patience
      of a cart-horse. But you&mdash;the wrong wife would wreck you and kill
      you. I am speaking frankly, laddie,&rdquo;&mdash;she gave the novel word an
      intonation which made it music in his ears&mdash;&ldquo;because you have no
      mother, and because you are going into a very trying and delicate
      situation with what I feel to be a pathetic lack of preparation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian drew his chair nearer to her, and crossed his knees, and leaned
      back in an attitude of intimate ease. The conversation appealed powerfully
      to him as having more of the atmosphere of domesticity and sweet home
      influences in it than any he had ever heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know almost nothing at all of women,&rdquo; he said, quite simply. &ldquo;The
      mothers of my pupils I saw sometimes and occasionally a sister, but they
      were not in any sense my friends. As to marriage&mdash;of course that has
      never been in my head. Until only the other day, the idea of a wife would
      have been absurd. But now&mdash;as you say&mdash;it is not any longer
      absurd.&rdquo; He paused and gazed absently past her, as if in pursuit of the
      thoughts his own words had set in motion. &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;I wonder&rdquo;&mdash;he
      murmured, and then turned his bright eyes to her, full of wistful
      expectancy. &ldquo;Have you, par exemple, some one in your mind for me?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and shook her head. The implication in his tone, of entire
      readiness to accept the bride of her selection, had its amusing and its
      flattering sides; upon a second glance, however, it contained something
      else not so much to her liking. She frowned a little at this something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you must not approach the subject in that spirit,&rdquo; she adjured him.
      &ldquo;It is the one affair of all others on earth in which you must be guided
      absolutely by your own heart and your own mind. We speak of the heart and
      mind as distinct from each other; I don&rsquo;t know that they are not one and
      the same. Perhaps I would put it this way&mdash;when your heart <i>and</i>
      your mind are completely agreed, when your personal liking and your
      deliberate judgment pull together in exactly the same direction&mdash;so
      that it seems to you that they <i>are</i> one and the same thing&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; demanded Christian, bending forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am not fortunate in expressing myself to-day,&rdquo; Kathleen declared,
      with a gesture of playful impatience. &ldquo;But in general, this is what I
      wanted to say: Do not be betrayed into haste in this matter of deciding
      about a girl. You will see a large number of extremely attractive young
      ladies. They will certainly not be looking or behaving their worst for
      your benefit, and you on your side will be lacking the experience to tell
      precisely what it is all worth. So walk quietly along, with your wits
      about you, and see what there is to be seen for a time, and commit
      yourself to nothing. A year hence, for example, you will look back upon
      your present condition of mind with surprise. You will not seem to
      yourself at all the same person. I can&rsquo;t promise that you&rsquo;ll be happier,&rdquo;
       she added, with a little smiling sigh, &ldquo;but you will know a great deal
      more about what you want&mdash;or rather about making sure that you are
      getting what you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I shall do,&rdquo; he declared, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection. &ldquo;I
      shall come always to you, and beg your wise and good advice. You will tell
      me if I am making a bad choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk as if you were entering upon a lifelong series of experiments,&rdquo;
       she laughed at him. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll undertake no such responsibility as that,
      young man.&rdquo; She explained, more gravely: &ldquo;It is never quite possible for a
      friend, no matter how wise and fond the friend may be, to advise upon this
      matter. To give information upon the subject, that is another affair. But
      specific advice, no. But let me finish what I had in mind to say. You have
      seen here, during this past fortnight, what great hopes are built upon
      your administration of your affairs when you come into the title. No,
      don&rsquo;t speak yet. You must not pledge yourself at all to the System. It
      would be unfair to let you do it. But at all events you have seen it, and
      you will think it all over, and, whether you take it up altogether or not,
      I know it will have its effect on you. You will set an ideal of usefulness
      and duty before you, and you will have your heart fixed on realizing it.
      Well, then, I counsel you above all things to keep that idea in mind
      whenever you think of marriage. A man has a good many sides to his life,
      but the side which is most vital to him is that of the work he wants to do
      in the world. If the wife fits perfectly on that side, the discrepancies
      elsewhere are of small account by comparison. They smooth away, they
      adjust themselves. But the misfit on the side of the man&rsquo;s ambitions&mdash;that
      never effaces itself. And so, just in proportion as the work you want to
      do becomes clear in your mind, you ought to define to yourself the type of
      woman who will be most sympathetic toward that work, and who will best
      help you in it&mdash;or rather, who will help you in it in the way you
      like best. I don&rsquo;t say you will find the perfect type of that woman&mdash;but
      you should have the type before you, and be able to measure people by its
      standards. But I have harangued you long enough! There is something in the
      atmosphere here: we all deliver lectures to each other at the most
      unscrupulous length. Poor boy! We&rsquo;ve done nothing but make speeches to you
      since you showed in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian deprecated her suggestion with persuasive hands. &ldquo;I have learned
      here, I think, all that I know,&rdquo; he protested. He did not, however, insist
      upon further generalizations. &ldquo;One thing you said,&rdquo; he remarked,
      thoughtfully, &ldquo;puts a question into my head. You said it was better to
      give information than advice. Now there is so much that I am in ignorance
      about. Perhaps I do wrong to ask you&mdash;but I am curious to know more
      about the people of the family&mdash;our own family. There are no ladies
      of my own blood? I mean, all I have seen or heard of come to us by
      marriage, like yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hit upon the weakest and unhappiest point,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;There has
      not been a daughter born in the Torr family for over a hundred years. I
      have always insisted that this has operated like a curse on the family.
      The beautiful humanizing charm of little girls about the house&mdash;this
      they have never felt. The mothers have had no daughters to lean upon, the
      men have never known what a sister was like. That one fact, it seems to
      me, is enough to account for everything that is hard and rough and cruel
      in their story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian bowed his head in silent token of comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am always more grieved than angry, when I&rsquo;m thinking of the black sheep
      in the family fold,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;They had never a chance. It was like a
      tradition in the family that the father should be a brute and the mother a
      fool. A daughter here and there might have softened the combination&mdash;but
      with little boys alone face to face with it&mdash;what could they do? They
      grew up in the stables and the kennels. Think of those two young men whom
      you met at Caermere, for example. Lord Julius told me of their scene with
      you, and I&rsquo;m far from blaming you&mdash;but think of their bringing up!
      Their father, Lord Edward, I remember very well. I saw him when I was a
      girl, at the Punchestown races, and my brother told me his name. Even
      without it, I should have remembered his face as the coarsest and meanest
      I ever saw. He married a woman out of some vile gambling set that he was
      in as a young man. She is still alive somewhere, and has an allowance from
      Lord Julius for suppressing herself, and not using the family name. Well,
      when I think of the blood in those two boys, and of the horrors of their
      childhood till they were taken away from their mother, and sent into the
      country to school&mdash;upon my soul I can only wonder that they come so
      near decency as they do. Your encounter with them happened to strike out
      sparks, but you must remember what a blow it represented to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man gave a somewhat perfunctory nod. His sympathies were somehow
      obdurate upon this particular point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, and that reminds me,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I said that the family was
      daughterless&mdash;but Eddy has a little girl. It is very quaint to think
      what she will grow up like, under the maternal wing of Cora Bayard. Yet I
      am told there are worse mothers than Cora. I&rsquo;ve never seen her, myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw her at Caermere,&rdquo; Christian remarked. &ldquo;She seemed very frightened
      and sad&mdash;and since it was because of me, I did not look much at her.
      I remember only the effect of a likeness to Pierrot&mdash;the red lips on
      the white face. But&rdquo;&mdash;he drew his chair still nearer, and betrayed by
      manner and tone alike his approach to a subject of more than casual
      interest&mdash;&ldquo;the other lady whom I saw there&mdash;Lady Cressage&mdash;I
      had much conversation with her. I feel that she and I are friends. I liked
      her very much indeed&mdash;but I have no information about her whatever.
      If I am permitted to confess it&mdash;I tried to talk about her with Lord
      Julius and with Emanuel, but they at once spoke of other things. You see
      how frankly I am telling you everything; that is because you make me feel
      so wonderfully at home. But perhaps you do not like to talk about her,
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled pleasantly enough in comment upon his faltering conclusion.
      &ldquo;Oh, I think you exaggerate the conspiracy of silence,&rdquo; she answered.
      &ldquo;Neither Lord Julius nor Emanuel has anything hostile to say about Edith
      Cressage, but she doesn&rsquo;t quite appeal to their imagination, and so they
      find nothing of any sort to say. But it is only fair to remember that they
      are both men with peculiar and exacting standards for women. They would be
      equally silent about a hundred other ladies of unblemished character, and
      of beauty and wit untold. It is nothing at all against her that she hasn&rsquo;t
      excited their enthusiasm. I do not know her at all well, but I think she
      is very nice. Now&mdash;is that what you wanted me to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mild note of banter which informed her words put Christian if possible
      even more at his ease. He stood up, with his hands in the sleek pockets of
      his new coat, and bent down upon her a joyous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ever so much more!&rdquo; he insisted, gaily. &ldquo;She is very beautiful; she
      has the air and the distinction of a grande dame; she speaks like a flute,
      and what she says is clever and apropos; she is unhappy, and yet with no
      bitterness toward any one; she seemed to like me very much, and, mind you,
      she was the first fine lady whom I had ever met. Enfin, she is my cousin,
      and the fact impresses me. What is more natural than that I should be
      eager to know all about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen did not respond readily to his mood. She knitted her brows
      slightly once more, and looked away from him toward the window. &ldquo;It is
      rather hard for me to explain,&rdquo; she began at last, doubtfully. &ldquo;From a
      good many points of view&mdash;her own included&mdash;I dare say we do her
      an injustice. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me; we are all sorry for her&mdash;and I
      for one have my moments of doubt whether we oughtn&rsquo;t to be something more
      than sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is the phrase,&rdquo; put in Christian, strenuously. &ldquo;I think that I
      myself am something more than sorry for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him, at first with a shadow of apprehension in her eyes.
      Then she estimated aright his enthusiasm with a gentle smile. &ldquo;I will
      explain as well as I can,&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;As you say, you are entitled
      to be told. The feeling, then, is&mdash;I am speaking of Lord Julius and
      Emanuel, and more or less of myself too&mdash;the feeling is that she
      ought not to have made the marriage she did. Everybody knew that the young
      man she married was a worthless creature&mdash;a violent, ignorant,
      low-minded fellow. You could not see him, much less talk with him, without
      recognizing this. One knows perfectly well that she must have hated the
      very thought of him as a lover or a companion. But he is the heir to a
      dukedom, and so she marries him. You see what I mean; it seemed an
      unpleasant thing to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian considered with a puzzled air the situation thus defined. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
       he commented, with hesitation, &ldquo;it is the metier of a young woman to get a
      husband, and to get the best one for herself that she can. If she is so
      beautiful that a man wishes to make her a duchess, why, that is her
      triumph. Would you have her forego it? And if she says &lsquo;no&rsquo;, why, then the
      next one he asks says &lsquo;yes&rsquo;&mdash;and it is merely that the first one has
      waived her place in the queue for another. The queue remains the same. And
      if this were not so, why, then, young men who are not very good, they
      would get no wives at all. But,&rdquo; he added, in extenuation of his dissent,
      &ldquo;all these matters are so differently regarded, you know, in France.&rdquo; She
      did not look altogether pleased with him. &ldquo;I thought you would have caught
      my meaning more readily,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;despite your Continental point of
      view. For that matter, it is the common English point of view also. There
      is a matrimonial market, of course, and girls offer themselves in it to
      the highest bidder, and nothing that we can do will change it. But at
      least we are free to think what we like of the wretched business&mdash;and
      to hold our own opinions of the people who traffic in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen had stated her position with a certain argumentative warmth,
      which gave her tone a novel effect of reproof. The sight now of the young
      man&rsquo;s saddened and surprised expression sent her mood up with a rebound.
      She put a hand on his arm, as he stood before her, and reassured him by a
      kindly laugh. &ldquo;Ah, now,&rdquo; she said, with genial pleading in her soft voice,
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be making a mountain of my molehill. I only wanted you to
      understand how we felt. And as I have told you, we have our reservations
      about even that feeling. The poor girl did only what she was expected to
      do&mdash;what her mother and her family and all the friends that
      surrounded her took it quite as a matter of course that she should do.
      Probably she never once encountered the opinion that she should do
      otherwise. No doubt that is to be said for her. In fact, I should never
      have dreamed of blaming her to you, if you had not pressed me. And after
      it&rsquo;s all said and done, you may take it from me that perhaps I don&rsquo;t blame
      her so very much. She was poor, and not over comfortable at home, I think,
      and she was very young, and people ran after her to an extraordinary
      extent&mdash;and to be the beauty of the season in London is enough to
      turn any one&rsquo;s head. Poor creature&mdash;it&rsquo;s bitterly enough she&rsquo;s paid
      for her whistle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled down into her eyes. &ldquo;That is how I knew you would end by
      speaking of her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is in that same way that she moves me&mdash;by
      my compassion. And this is my fancy&rdquo;&mdash;he began, in a more vivacious
      tone&mdash;&ldquo;I should like to tell it to you&mdash;it seems that I am to
      have the power to do so many such wonderful things&mdash;well, then,
      nothing would delight me more than to be very good to her. It is my <i>fantaisie</i>&mdash;and
      there is no harm in it, <i>is</i> there?&mdash;to atone to her for some of
      the unhappiness she has suffered. I have thought about it much since I
      left Caermere. It seems that it would be a good thing for me to do&mdash;like
      an act of piety. You must remember&mdash;she was the first lady who spoke
      kindly to me in England. And I think you will be pleased with me for being
      grateful. But, of course, if Emanuel tells me &lsquo;no&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no one will tell you &lsquo;no,&rsquo;&rdquo; she assured him, rising as she spoke, and
      looking into his face with beaming eyes. &ldquo;It is the kind of spirit we like
      in you. Never imagine that we will be obstacles in its way. Only be on
      your guard against the soft heart running away with you. The world is full
      of clever and adroit people who practice upon innocent generosity. It is
      not so much the worth of what they wheedle from you, as the shock of your
      discovery of their tricks. That hurts a young nature, and very often
      callouses and hardens it. But here I am, lecturing you again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian had not, in truth, been following her remarks with complete
      attention. Something had come up in his mind, which by the time she
      stopped he seemed to have turned over and over, and examined from many
      standpoints, and finally decided to speak about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not wholly exact,&rdquo; he began, with constraint, &ldquo;when I said that
      Lady Cressage was the first lady who spoke kindly to me in England. I
      mentioned it to Lord Julius&mdash;there was a very charming and good young
      lady who traveled with me from Rouen, and crossed on the boat&mdash;and it
      is a very curious thing, but when we became acquainted, and I hinted to
      her about my story, she knew who I was. Indeed, it was she who told me who
      I was. I had the whole wonderful tale from her&mdash;and the kindness and
      sweet sympathy with which she told it to me, a little at a time&mdash;ah,
      that is what I will never forget! I am bound to remember her with
      gratitude all my life. And that is another <i>fantaisie</i> of mine&mdash;that
      I shall do something good for her. Oh, she has no selfish thoughts! She
      would not even tell me her name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen&rsquo;s comment was prefaced by a mirthful chuckle. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t deny that
      gratitude is a very active and resourceful element in your composition,&rdquo;
       she declared, and laughed again. &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll advertise for her. How would
      this do: &lsquo;The young lady who meets returning lost heirs to the British
      nobility at Rouen, and lets them down easily&rsquo;? Or we might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Christian interrupted, pleadingly, &ldquo;I am really very sincere about
      her. You cannot imagine anything finer or more delicate than her
      character. And besides,&rdquo;&mdash;he added this with visible reluctance&mdash;&ldquo;I
      have learned since who she is. Lady Cressage told me. She is the sister of
      the lady you call Cora&mdash;the wife of that young man Edward&mdash;but
      she is not an actress! It is not in the least her <i>type!</i> She earns
      her own living&mdash;she has some work to do&mdash;I think it is with a
      writing-machine&mdash;that is, a type-writer, n&rsquo;est-ce pas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Emanuel did not immediately reply, but moved to the window, looked
      out and then walked slowly back to where he stood. &ldquo;I am not going to
      suggest an unkind thought about this girl,&rdquo; she said, deliberately. &ldquo;I
      would not want you to think differently of her, or of the grateful impulse
      you have toward her. Indeed, I have heard something of her&mdash;and it is
      much to her credit. But&mdash;this sounds a mean thing to say, and yet it
      has its important true side&mdash;people should stick to their class. Bear
      that always in mind. There seem to be brilliant exceptions to the rule,
      whenever we look about us&mdash;but just the same, the rule exists. But&mdash;now
      I <i>will</i> stop, once for all!&rdquo; She mused at him, with a twinkling eye.
      &ldquo;You poor lad, there&rsquo;s something about you that draws down lectures as a
      lightning-rod draws electricity. And here&rsquo;s the trap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Emanuel returned from London a few days later, to report that his
      young cousin had been comfortably installed in chambers on Duke Street,
      St. James&rsquo;s, and seemed to get on capitally with Lord Lingfield, who was
      showing him the ropes, Kathleen received the news with less than her
      accustomed cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been quite happy, thinking of him alone in London,&rdquo; she
      admitted, in the course of their conversation. &ldquo;I feel, somehow, as if we
      should have gone up, and taken a house for the winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but, sweetheart,&rdquo; he urged, almost reproachfully, &ldquo;you see how I am
      up to my eyes in all sorts of work. This is really about the most trying
      and ticklish stage we have gone through yet. If the fibrous silk processes
      are what is claimed for them, and your girls display the aptitude that you
      count upon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Kathleen for once seemed not to listen. She had turned, and moved a
      few steps listlessly away. She took a flower from a vase, picked it to
      pieces and gazed in a brown study at the meaningless fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; she remarked at last, with a half sigh. Then she threw the
      petals into the grate, and, with a decisive little shake of head and
      shoulders, wheeled round, and came smilingly to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whom did you see in town?&rdquo; she asked.

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>oward the end of
      April, there came an afternoon on which Christian seemed to himself to
      wake up of a sudden as from a harassed sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been in England for over six months, when all at once he became
      conscious of this queer sensation: the experiences of his half year put
      themselves together before his mental eye in the aspect of a finished
      volume&mdash;of something definitely over and done with.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was warm spring in the London air, and at first the vague feeling of
      unrest impressed him as a part of the general vernal effect. The device of
      taking a stroll through the parks, to note the early flowers and the
      wonderful infancy of leafage among the trees, seemed at the outset to fit
      this new mood that was upon him. Then abruptly he wearied of nature and
      turned his back upon it, driving in a hansom to his club. Here there was
      no one whom he knew, or at least cared to speak with. He sat for a time in
      the billiard-room, watching with profound inattention the progress of a
      game he knew nothing about. From this he wandered into the library, where
      some fierce-faced old gentlemen slept peacefully in armchairs about the
      alcoves. The sound of their breathing vexed him; he pretended to himself
      that otherwise he would have found solace in a book. The whim seized him
      to go home to his chambers, and have tea there comfortably in gown and
      slippers, and finish a novel Lady Milly Poynes had induced him to begin
      weeks before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in his own easy-chair, the romance lying opened beside him, he put
      back his head, stretched his feet and yawned. He left untasted the tea
      which Falkner brought in; with fingers interlaced behind his neck he
      stared up at the blue of the sky through his window in formless
      rumination.
    </p>
    <p>
      His earlier glimpses of London were dim enough memories now. The town had
      been described by his cousin Lingfield as empty when he arrived, and after
      a few days of desultory sight-seeing, he had been carried off to the earl
      of Chobham&rsquo;s place in Derbyshire. Here, among people who behaved like
      kindly kinsmen to the young new-comer, yet failed to arouse much interest
      in his mind, he learned to shoot well enough to escape open protests by
      the autocratic head gamekeeper, and to keep his seat in the saddle after a
      fashion of his own. These acquirements stood him in good stead at the four
      or five other country houses to which the amiable Lingfield in due course
      led him. Without them, meager as they were, he would have been in a sorry
      plight indeed. They provided him with a certain semblance of justification
      for his presence among people who seemed incapable of amusing themselves
      or their guests in any other way. There were always ladies, it was true,
      and it was generally manifest to him that he might spend his time with
      them if he chose, but after a few tentative experiments he fell back upon
      the conviction that he did not know how to talk to English ladies. He
      drifted somehow through these months of hospitable entertainment, feeling
      that he had never known before what loneliness could mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at Christmas, he went to spend another fortnight with Emanuel, he
      had it in his heart to confess to disappointment, and even depression. He
      had not thus far fitted at all into the place which had been prepared for
      him, and he looked forward, with wistful eagerness, as he journeyed
      westward, to the balm of sympathy and tender comprehension with which
      Kathleen and Emanuel, dear people that they were, would soothe and heal
      his wounded self-consciousness. Somehow, the opportunity of unburdening
      his troubled mind, however, did not come to him. There were other guests,
      including Lord Julius, and such exceptional attention was devoted on the
      estates to elaborating the holiday festivities of the various villages,
      that no individual could hope to secure consideration for his own private
      emotions. It was sometimes suspected that Emanuel made so much of
      Christmas in his System, unconsciously no doubt, because the Jewish side
      of him felt the need of ostentation in its disavowal of theological
      prejudices. For whatever reason, the festival was observed here in a
      remarkable spirit. The little churches were embowered in holly and
      mistletoe, and were the scenes of numerous ornate services. There were
      processions, merry-makings, midnight visitations of the &ldquo;waits,&rdquo; concerts
      and dances throughout the week, and only the strictly necessary work of
      the community was performed meanwhile. On New Year&rsquo;s Day the rejoicings
      culminated in a children&rsquo;s carnival from one end of the property to the
      other, with big trees laden with lights and gifts in the German fashion,
      and exhibitions of the magic lantern, and other juvenile delights. The
      fortnight passed, and Christian returned to London, as has been said,
      without having anything like the intimate talk he had expected. Both
      Kathleen and Emanuel had seemed pleased with him; they had noted with
      approving comment his progress in the use of idiomatic English, and his
      rapid assimilation of the manners and bearing of those about him; they had
      heard none but welcome reports of him from outside, and made clear to him
      their gratification at the fact. Their smile for him was as affectionate,
      their display of pleasure in his presence as marked, as ever, but he had
      the sense, none the less, of something altered. Lord Julius bore him
      company on his journey to London, and after a brief halt, took him away
      again for another fortnight, this time at Brighton. He was no more
      successful with the father, in the matter of helpful confidences, than he
      had been with the son. It was impossible to tell the strong, big,
      redoubtable old gentleman of what he felt to be his weaknesses. A kind of
      desponding pride possessed him, and closed his lips. He was not happy, as
      he had supposed he would be, and he could not bring himself to feel that
      at any point the fault was his. It was the position that was incongruous.
      Yet how could he complain, or avow his discontent, without seeming an
      ingrate to the benefactors whose heart had been in the work of shaping and
      gilding that position for him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Parliament met this year in January, and Christian saw now a London which
      he had not imagined to himself&mdash;for which nothing, indeed, had
      prepared him. There came all at once a great many invitations, and the
      young man, surprised and not a little dismayed, called Lord Lingfield to
      his assistance. The prospect unfolded to him by this accomplished
      professor of the proprieties was terrifying enough. At the end of a week
      Christian cried out that the reality was too much. But Lingfield could see
      no alternative to going on. &ldquo;You will get used to it soon enough, now that
      you have once taken the plunge,&rdquo; he assured him. &ldquo;There are certain things
      that a fellow has to do, you know, when he&rsquo;s in London in the season, or
      even now, in what you may call the half season, unless he&rsquo;s going to chuck
      the thing altogether.&rdquo; Christian replied with excitement that this was
      precisely what he wished to do. In his own mind he had already reached the
      point of debating whether he could honorably go on using the money placed
      to his credit at the bank, most of which was still there, if he fled from
      London, and even England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lingfield was a fine young man, irreproachable in attire and manners,
      who expected to do something in politics, and who regarded his duty both
      to the future which he hoped to create for himself, and to the immediate
      present which had been created for him, with conscientious gravity. He had
      never thought of lightening or evading the tasks set before him; he had no
      perception whatever of the possibility of making such things easier for
      others. He assured Christian with gentle solemnity that desertion was not
      to be mentioned, and that even mitigation was undesirable. &ldquo;It has all
      been arranged for you,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Upon my word, you are very lucky. You
      have been to two houses already where I never get asked except to
      luncheon, and here is a card here which I could hardly believe my eyes to
      see To trifle with such chances would be simple madness. You will get to
      have all London at your fingers&rsquo; ends, your very first season. Such a
      start as you&rsquo;re likely to have, I&rsquo;ve never seen in my life. My dear fellow&mdash;you
      don&rsquo;t understand what it means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m tired to death!&rdquo; groaned Christian. &ldquo;No doubt they are excellent
      people, but they weary me to the bone. The dinners, the calls, the
      receptions, the dances&mdash;I have no talent whatever for these things.
      It is very kind of these people&mdash;but I know I am ridiculous in it
      all. I give them no pleasure, and God knows I receive none. Then why must
      it go on? For whose benefit is it? I swear to you, I would not mind the
      labor and fatigue, if it was any good that I was doing. Emanuel, for
      example, toils like a slave, but then his work has great results. But this
      of mine&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; interposed Lingfield, smilingly. &ldquo;But Emanuel could never have
      made much running in London. He disputes with people too much, don&rsquo;t you
      know. They don&rsquo;t like that. And I think you make much too hard work of it
      all. There&rsquo;s no need for <i>you</i> to talk, you know. It isn&rsquo;t expected
      of you. And I don&rsquo;t see why you can&rsquo;t move quietly along, going
      everywhere, being seen at the right places, and being civil to everybody,
      and not worry yourself at all. That&rsquo;s what you need, my dear boy&mdash;repose!
      Let the other people do the worry. Now, of course, in a case like Dicky
      Westland&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s different. He has to be amusing and useful, or he wouldn&rsquo;t
      get asked. But you are not on all fours with him at all. To tell the truth&mdash;no
      doubt it&rsquo;ll sound strange to you, but it is the truth all the same&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      better form for you not to be amusing, or brilliant, or that sort of
      thing. Fellows in your place don&rsquo;t go in for it, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian sighed, and chafing at the necessity of submission, still
      submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as he lay back in his chair, the retrospect was augmented by six
      other weeks, in which he had passively yielded to what Lingfield had
      assured him was the inevitable. He had dined out almost every-night, and
      had made countless calls. It seemed to him that he must have met everybody
      in this huge metropolis who had a pair of shoulders or possessed a dress
      coat. He yawned at the thought of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he not himself to blame for this? At Christmas time he had been quite
      confident in answering &ldquo;no&rdquo; to this question; now he did not feel so sure
      about it. At one place or another he had come into contact with most of
      the members of the government, and with many of those distinguished
      statesmen on the opposite bench who, by the grace of the genial British
      electorate, would be ministers next time. He had talked with eminent
      artists, eminent scientists, eminent writers, eminent soldiers and
      sailors, and watched them and listened to them as they sat over their
      cigars, or moved about among the ladies in the drawing-rooms. Hostesses
      whose cordial good will toward him seemed equaled only by their capable
      control over others, had said to him time and time again: &ldquo;If there is any
      one you want to know, tell me.&rdquo; The phrase lingered in his mind as a
      symbol of his position. He had merely to mention his wish, like some lucky
      person of the fables who possessed a talisman. It could not be said that
      he had used his magic power foolishly or perversely. He had followed in
      dutiful, painstaking solicitude the path marked out for him by his
      advisers. He had done the best that was in him to do; he had gone wherever
      Lingfield bade him go; he had loyally kept awake late at night; he had
      smiled and bowed and spoken affable words; he had fulfilled punctually all
      the engagements imposed upon him. What was more, he could no longer
      pretend that he made a failure of the thing; it was known to him that he
      had created a pleasant impression upon London, and that people liked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that, he could not feel that in turn he liked these people. Among
      those of whom he had seen the most, was there any whom he profoundly
      desired ever to see again? He passed some random figures in mental review,
      and suffered them to vanish without thrusting forth any tentacle of
      thought to detain them. They had not entered his real life; they meant
      nothing to him. Positively he was as much alone in London to-day as he had
      been when he first set foot in it. Indeed, was he not the poorer to-day by
      all those lost illusions and joyous, ardent hopes now faded to
      nothingness? In return for these departed treasures, he had only empty
      hands to show&mdash;and a jaded, futilely mutinous, empty mind as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soft, equable tinkle of the door-bell caught his ear, but scarcely
      arrested his attention. Perhaps unconsciously the sound served to polarize
      his thoughts, for suddenly it became apparent to him that he was in
      revolt. All this intolerable social labor was ended for him&mdash;definitely
      and irrevocably ended. He would not dine at another house; he would burn
      forthwith his basket of cards, and the little book with its foolish record
      of ladies&rsquo; days &ldquo;at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat up and sipped at his lukewarm tea, with the glow of a new resolve
      on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Falkner&mdash;a smooth-mannered, assiduous, likable man of middle age whom
      Emanuel had given him from his own household&mdash;entered the room to
      announce a caller. A brisk, alert tread on the polished hall floor behind
      him cut into his words, so that Christian did not catch them. He rose, and
      looked inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant, he felt that he was not glad to see the person who came
      in. It was a young man of about his age, tall and fair, and handsome in a
      buoyant, bright-faced way of his own. His blue eyes sparkled cheerfully
      into Christian&rsquo;s doubtful glance, and he held out a hand as he advanced.
      Everybody in the world called him Dicky Westland, and for this opening
      moment Christian thought of him as preeminently typical of all the
      vanities and artificialities he was on the point of forswearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not seedy, I hope?&rdquo; the new-comer said in comment upon the other&rsquo;s loose
      attire&mdash;and perhaps upon his dubious countenance as well. His voice
      had a musical vivacity in it which seemed to lighten the room. Christian,
      as he took the hand and shook his head, smiled a little. It began to occur
      to him that really he did like this young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, with a gesture toward a chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right. Only the
      whim seized me&mdash;to come home and read a book. I got homesick, I
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This statement, once in the air, seemed funny to the young men, and Dicky
      Westland laughed aloud. Christian, sitting down opposite his visitor, felt
      himself sharing his animation. &lsquo;&ldquo;It was good of you to come,&rdquo; he declared,
      with a refreshed tone. &ldquo;The truth is, I&rsquo;m tired out. I am up too late. I
      run about too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a fellow does get hipped,&rdquo; assented Dicky. &ldquo;But you are so
      tremendously regular, it doesn&rsquo;t do you any harm. A days&rsquo; rest now and
      then, and you&rsquo;re right as a trivet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regular,&rdquo; Christian repeated, musingly. He formed his lips to utter some
      reflection upon the theme, and then closed them again. &ldquo;Will you have a
      cup of tea?&rdquo; he asked, with the air of thinking of something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other shook his head, and preserved a posture of vivacious
      anticipation, as if Christian had made a literal promise to unburden his
      mind. The suggestion was so complete that Christian accepted it as a
      mandate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you came,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because&mdash;well, because I have come to
      a conclusion in my mind, and I should like to put it into words for you&mdash;so
      that I can also hear it myself. I am resolved to go away&mdash;to leave
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dicky lifted his brows in puzzled interrogation. &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like it,&rdquo; Christian replied, speaking more readily now, and
      enforcing his words with eager hands. Lingfield had cautioned him against
      this gesticulatory tendency, but the very consciousness that he was in
      rebellion brought his hands upward into the conversation. &ldquo;It is not what
      I care for. I come into it too late, no doubt, to understand&mdash;appreciate
      it, properly. The people I meet&mdash;I have no feeling for them. It seems
      a waste of my time to sit with them, to stand and talk, to go about from
      one of their houses to another. At the end of it all, there is nothing.
      They have all thick shells on, and they are not going to let me get inside
      of them. And, moreover, if I did get inside, who can be sure there would
      be anything of value there? It does not often look so to me, from the
      outside. But it is a waste of time and labor, and it does not amuse me in
      the least, and why should I pursue it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right!&rdquo; said Dicky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you agree with me?&mdash;you approve?&rdquo; asked Christian, not
      concealing his surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do. It&rsquo;s awful rot,&rdquo; the other affirmed. He observed his host
      silently for a space, and meanwhile, by a quite visible process, the
      familiar external elasticity, not to say flippancy, of his manner seemed
      to fall away from him. &ldquo;With me, of course,&rdquo; he went on, almost gravely,
      &ldquo;I have to do it. I must get my secretaryship, or I can&rsquo;t live. My
      relations could put me into the swim, but they can&rsquo;t support me there
      indefinitely. I have only two aunts, you know&mdash;dear old things, they
      are&mdash;and they keep me going, but they have only life interests, and I
      fancy they have to scrape a little as it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; pursued Dicky Westland, &ldquo;I must help myself, and it&rsquo;s only
      by knowing the right people, and being seen at the right places, that a
      fellow can bring anything off. For example, now: Lady Winsey is a distant
      cousin of mine, and she&rsquo;s promised the aunts, you know, and there&rsquo;s an old
      Sir Hogface Something-or-Other dodging about the place, who&rsquo;s going to get
      a West Indian governorship in May, and Lady Winsey has not only had him at
      her house to dinner, where he could see me, but has contrived to throw me
      at him at three other houses. Next week I&rsquo;m to go down to a closing meet
      in Berkshire, just because he&rsquo;s to be there&mdash;and that she arranged,
      too. And it&rsquo;s all to get a place worth perhaps three hundred a year, with
      yellow fever thrown in&mdash;if it comes to anything at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hundred a year,&rdquo; commented Christian, knitting his brows. &ldquo;I still
      make pounds into francs to know what a sum means,&rdquo; he explained,
      smilingly, after a moment. &ldquo;Once I would have thought that a great fortune&mdash;and
      only a few months ago, too, at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see how it is,&rdquo; said Dicky. &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t let any chance slip by.
      But if I stood in your shoes, dear God! how I would chuck it all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what would you do instead?&rdquo; Christian propounded this question
      sitting back in his chair, with the tips of his fingers joined, and a calm
      twinkle in his eye. He discovered himself feeling as if it were his
      companion who had made confessions and craved sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dicky looked into his hat, and pouted his lips in whimsical indecision.
      &ldquo;What I mean is,&rdquo; he explained at last&mdash;&ldquo;my point was this&mdash;I
      hate the whole thing, and if I didn&rsquo;t have to do it, why then I wouldn&rsquo;t
      do it, d&rsquo;ye see? I&rsquo;d go about with nobody except the people I really cared
      about&mdash;my right-down, intimate friends. That&rsquo;s the idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;friends!&rdquo; said Christian. &ldquo;That is the word that sings in my
      ears!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose impulsively, and began walking about the room with a restless
      step. Now and again he halted briefly to look down upon his companion, to
      enforce with eyes as well as gesture some special thing in his talk. &ldquo;Yes,
      friends!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Tell me, you Dicky Westland, where are friends to be
      found? Have you some, perhaps? Then where did you come upon them? It is
      what I should like very much to know. Listen to me! I have been in England
      six months. I possess in England, say two&mdash;three&mdash;no, five
      friends&mdash;and all these came to me in my first week here. All but one
      belong to my family, so they were here, ready-made for me. But since that
      time, now that I am for myself, I have not gained one friend. Is there
      then something strange&mdash;what do I say&mdash;forbidding in me? Or no&mdash;it
      is nonsense for me to say that. It is the other way about. I have seen
      nobody who awakened voices within me. There has been no one who appealed
      to me as a friend should appeal. I live among a thousand rich and fine
      people who are as good to me as they know how to be&mdash;and yet I am as
      if I lived in a desert. And it is very cold&mdash;and lonely&mdash;and
      heartbreaking in this desert of mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Westland looked at him, as he stood now in the pathetic abandonment of his
      peroration, with a contemplative squint in one eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; he remarked finally. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been looking for flesh
      and blood, and you find only gun-metal.&rdquo; He thrust out his lips a little,
      and gave further consideration to the problem. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any need for
      you to go away, you know,&rdquo; he added after a pause. &ldquo;You can have any kind
      of life you like in London. It is all here, if you want it. But what is it
      that you do want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian threw himself sidewise into his chair, and bent his head with a
      sigh. Then, with a new light in his eyes, he looked up. &ldquo;You yourself said
      it&rdquo;&mdash;he exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;to see only my true friends. That is my idea
      of life: To have a small circle of people whom I love very much, and to
      make constant opportunities to be with some of them&mdash;talking as we
      like to talk, going about together, making life happy for one another as
      we go along. All my youth, I envied rich people, because I thought that
      they used their wealth to command this greatest of delights. I imagined
      that if one had much money, then one could afford to spend his time only
      with his close, dear friends. But what I discover is that they do
      something entirely different. They seem not to let friendship come into
      their lives at all. They desire only acquaintances, and of these the more
      they have the better, if they bear the proper cachet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the women,&rdquo; said Dicky, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They like the crowd, and the new faces. And what they like, of course
      they have. They run the whole show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian nodded comprehension&mdash;then put out a hand to signalize a
      reservation. &ldquo;I know women&mdash;here in England&mdash;who have a higher
      idea than this,&rdquo; he declared, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, so we all do,&rdquo; assented Westland. &ldquo;There are a million
      splendid women, if one could only get at them. But it&rsquo;s a sort of trades
      union, don&rsquo;t you know. You don&rsquo;t take the workmen you want, on your own
      terms; you take those the society gives you, and the terms are arranged
      for you. It&rsquo;s like that with women. You meet some awfully jolly girls now
      and then, but they are not in the least degree their own masters. If you
      try to get to know them well, either they&rsquo;re frightened, and pull back
      into their shells, or you&rsquo;re headed off by their mothers. But,&rdquo; he added
      upon reflection&mdash;&ldquo;of course it&rsquo;s different with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least I am not interested,&rdquo; said Christian, wearily. The advice of
      Kathleen had produced upon his mind an even greater effect, perhaps, than
      he imagined. He had encountered, by the dozen, extremely beautiful and
      engaging girls, whose charm should have been enhanced in his eyes by the
      dignity and even grandeur of their surroundings. But an impalpable yet
      efficient barrier had stood always between them and him. If they exhibited
      reserve, he was too shy for words. If they expanded toward him with smiles
      or any freedom of demeanor, he recalled instantly the warning of Emanuel&rsquo;s
      wife, and that was fatal. &ldquo;I have not cared for any of them,&rdquo; he
      reaffirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Westland of a sudden, his comely, boyish face beaming with the
      thought that had come to him. &ldquo;How stupid of me! I&rsquo;d forgotten what I came
      for&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not sure it doesn&rsquo;t precisely fill the bill. Are you
      doing anything to-night? Will you come with me to the Hanover Theater at
      midnight? It&rsquo;s the five-hundredth performance of &lsquo;Pansy Blossoms&rsquo;&mdash;and
      there&rsquo;s to be supper on the stage and a dance. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve seen
      much of that sort of thing, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian shook his head, and regarded his companion doubtfully. &ldquo;Nothing
      at all of it,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;But it does not attract me very much, I&rsquo;m
      afraid. You would better take some one else. I should be a fish out of
      water there. The people of the theaters&mdash;they are not congenial to me&mdash;that
      is, I do not think they would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, hang it all, man, how do you know till you&rsquo;ve tried?&rdquo; Dicky put a
      little worldly authority into his tone as he proceeded. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t mind
      my saying it to you&mdash;it is you who make your own desert, as you call
      it, for yourself. If you say in advance that you know you won&rsquo;t like this
      sort of person, or that, how are you ever going to form any friendships?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian received the remonstrance with meekness. &ldquo;You do not quite
      understand me,&rdquo; he said, amiably enough. &ldquo;I have some work to do in the
      world, and I don&rsquo;t think that actresses and actors would help me much to
      do it. The young men who run after them do not seem, somehow, to do much
      else. It is only a prejudice I have; it applies only to myself. If others
      feel differently, why, I have not a word to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you must come!&rdquo; Westland declared, rising. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nonsense for you not
      to see that side of things. My dear fellow, it&rsquo;s as respectable as the
      Royal Academy&mdash;or Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s. Are you dining anywhere? Then
      I&rsquo;ll run home and dress, and I&rsquo;ll drive round here for you. We&rsquo;ll dine
      together, and then look in at some of the halls. Shall I say seven? It
      gives us more time over our dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian accepted, with a rueful little smile, his committal to the
      enterprise. &ldquo;You must not mind if I come away early,&rdquo; he said, getting to
      his feet in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed at him. &ldquo;My dear man, you&rsquo;ll never want to come away at
      all. But no, seriously&mdash;it&rsquo;s just the kind of thing you want. It&rsquo;ll
      amuse you, for one thing&mdash;and deuce take it, you&rsquo;ll be young only
      once in your life. But more than that&mdash;here you are swearing that
      you&rsquo;ll do no more social work at all, and you don&rsquo;t know in the least what
      other resources are open to you. It isn&rsquo;t alone actresses that you meet at
      a place like this, but all sorts of clever people who know how to get what
      there is out of life. That is what you yourself want to do, isn&rsquo;t it?
      Well, it&rsquo;ll do you no harm, to say the least, to see how they go about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; Christian replied, as the other turned. &ldquo;I will be ready at
      seven.&rdquo; He followed him to the door, and into the hallway. &ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; he
      said, half jokingly, half gravely, as he leaned over the banister, &ldquo;I have
      not altogether promised. When midnight comes, I may lose my courage
      altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s that kind of timidity that storms every fortress in its path,&rdquo;
       Dicky called up to him from the stairway.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he two young men
      dined at the Café Royal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good a kitchen as there is in London,
      and in the matter of people it isn&rsquo;t such a tiresome repetition of those
      one meets everywhere else as Willis&rsquo;s or the Prince&rsquo;s. To see the same
      shoulders and the same necks, night after night&mdash;a fellow gets tired
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this explanation by Dicky of his choice, as they rolled forward in
      their hansom, Christian made no direct response. After a little he said:
      &ldquo;Very soon now, I am going to do something that seems to have been in my
      mind for months. Perhaps I have only thought of it since this afternoon: I
      cannot be sure. But I am going to do it&mdash;I am going to know for
      myself what the real London and the real England are like. A thousand
      gentlemen in black clothes and silk hats, a thousand ladies with low-cut
      dresses and feathers in their hair&mdash;all thinking and talking about
      themselves and their own little affairs&mdash;that does not mean London.
      And a few large houses in the country, where these same people spend a few
      months riding after the hounds and shooting tame birds and wearying each
      other with idle, sleepy talk&mdash;that does not represent England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; cried Westland. &ldquo;I should say that&rsquo;s just what it did, worse
      luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; protested Christian. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be told that it does&mdash;for
      then I should want to go away altogether. No&mdash;there is the other
      thing, and I am going to find it out, and see it and know it. When all
      those years of my boyhood and youth I was so proud of being an Englishman,
      it was not this empty, valueless life of the West End, or the chase of
      foxes and birds in the country, that I longed for, and nourished pride
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but they do other things, you know,&rdquo; laughed Dicky. &ldquo;They are in
      Parliament, some of them, or they are at the bar, or in the Services, or
      they manage estates or are directors in companies, and that sort of thing.
      And some of them go in a lot for charities, and work on committees and
      organize things, you know. You&rsquo;d hardly believe how much of that most of
      the women let themselves in for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not what I mean,&rdquo; said the other, rather abruptly. &ldquo;To me all
      that is not worth the snap of a finger,&rdquo; and he emphasized his words by a
      gestured with the hand which rested on the door of the hansom.
    </p>
    <p>
      At an advanced stage of the dinner, the young men came to the subject
      again. In reply to a random inquiry Christian said that his grandfather,
      the duke, as far as he knew, was neither worse nor better in health than
      he had been all winter. &ldquo;I have not been to Caermere since my first
      visit,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I am really living upon a programme arranged for me,
      I should think, by a committee of my relations. Lord Lingfield is my
      active bear-leader. He conducts me, or sends me, wherever it has been
      decided that I shall go. It was not deemed important that I should go to
      Caermere again&mdash;and so I have not gone. Voilà tout! If I had been
      free to myself, I think I should have gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be an awfully jolly place, from the pictures I&rsquo;ve seen of it,&rdquo;
       said Westland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jolly!&rdquo; cried Christian. &ldquo;My dear creature, it is a grave, a mausoleum, a
      place of skulls and dead men&rsquo;s bones! You have never seen such a family
      vault in all your days. When I even begin to think of undertaking the task
      of brightening it into life again, I grow dizzy. The immensity of the work
      unnerves me. And now I do not know if I shall ever put my hand to it. The
      country-gentleman idea&mdash;which you make so much of in England&mdash;it
      does not appeal to me. It is too idle&mdash;too purposeless. Of course my
      cousin Emanuel, he makes a terrible toil of it&mdash;and does some
      wonderful things, beyond doubt. But after all, what does it come to? He
      helps people to be extremely fine who without him would only be tolerably
      fine. But I have the feeling that one should help those who are not fine
      at all&mdash;who have never had the chance to be fine, who do not know
      what it means. Emanuel&rsquo;s wife&mdash;oh, a very lovely character&mdash;she
      said to me that they disliked coming up to town, the sight of the London
      poor distressed them so much. Well, that is the point&mdash;if I am to
      help anybody at all, it is the London poor that I should try to help.
      Emanuel&rsquo;s plan is to give extra bones, and teach new tricks, to dogs
      already very comfortable. My heart warms to the dogs without collars, the
      homeless and hungry devils who look for bones in the gutters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re going in for settlements and that sort of thing,&rdquo; commented
      Dicky. &ldquo;I hear that is rather disappointing work. If you don&rsquo;t take the
      sporting papers at the reading-room they say the men won&rsquo;t come at all.
      Slingsby Chetwynd was awfully keen on the thing. He went down to stop a
      whole week&mdash;at Shoreditch or Houndsditch or the Isle of Dogs, or
      somewhere like that&mdash;and a woman smashed his hat in, and he fell into
      a cellar&mdash;and he was jolly glad to get back again the same night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian was pursuing thoughts of his own. The wine was admirable&mdash;as
      indeed it should have been considering the pains Dicky had been at, with
      pursed lips and lifted eyebrows, in the selection of it&mdash;and
      Christian had found an unaccustomed pleasure in its aromatic, sub-acid
      taste. He had drunk rather freely of it, and was satisfied with himself
      for having done so. He leaned back in his chair now, and watching the
      golden fountain of bubbles forever streaming upward in his glass, mused
      upon welcome new impulses within him toward the life of a free man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None the less,&rdquo; he remarked, indifferent to the irrelevancy of his theme,
      &ldquo;I should have liked to go to Caermere during the winter. I am annoyed
      with myself now that I did not go&mdash;whether it was arranged for me or
      not. There is a lady there for whom I felt great sympathy. I had expected
      to be of service to her long before this&mdash;but I am of service to no
      one. She is a cousin&mdash;no doubt you know her&mdash;Lady Cressage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is in London,&rdquo; put in Westland. &ldquo;I only know her a little, but
      Lady Selton used to be by way of seeing a good deal of her. She told me
      last week that she was in town&mdash;taken a little flat somewhere&mdash;Victoria
      Street way, I think. She doesn&rsquo;t go in for being very smart, you know. Why&mdash;yes&mdash;of
      course she&rsquo;s your cousin by marriage. Awfully pretty woman she was. Gad!
      how well I remember her season! All the fellows went quite off their
      heads. How funny&mdash;that she should be your cousin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian took no note of his companion&rsquo;s closing words, or of the tone in
      which they had been uttered. He scowled at the playful bubbles in his
      glass, as he reflected that the news of her arrival in London ought not to
      have come to him in this roundabout, accidental way. Why did none of his
      own people tell him? Or still more to the point, why had not she herself
      told him? He really had given her only an occasional and sporadic thought,
      during these past four or five months. Now, as he frowned at his wine, it
      seemed to him that his whole winter had been burdened with solicitude for
      her. Or no, &ldquo;burdened&rdquo; was an ungracious word, and false to boot. He would
      say &ldquo;mellowed&rdquo; or &ldquo;enriched&rdquo; instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must find out for me&rdquo;&mdash;he began, and then, upon a second thought
      born of pique, checked himself. &ldquo;Or do not mind&mdash;it is of no
      consequence. I shall hear as a matter of course.&rdquo; He called for the bill
      with a decision in his voice which seemed full of warning that the topic
      was exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Westland could not help observing the fat roll of crackling white notes
      which the other drew from his pocket. If they were all of the smallest
      denomination, they must still represent something like his whole year&rsquo;s
      allowance. The general understanding that Christian&rsquo;s unfamiliarity with
      English ways excused, and even invited, wise admonition from his friends,
      prompted him to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a lot to carry about with you, old man,&rdquo; he said, in gentle
      expostulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I like it!&rdquo; Christian declared, with shining eyes. He snapped the
      elastic band about the roll, with an air of boyish delight in the sound,
      as he returned it to his pocket. &ldquo;If you knew the years in which I counted
      my sous!&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock when they left. Beginning with the Pavilion,
      they went to four or five music halls, only to find that there were no
      seats to be had. &ldquo;Why, of course it&rsquo;s the boat-race,&rdquo; exclaimed Dicky at
      last. &ldquo;Stupid of me to have forgotten it. I say, I ought to have come for
      you this morning, and taken you up the river to see it. It&rsquo;s worth seeing&mdash;for
      once. I wonder Lingfield did not arrange it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, several people asked me to join their parties,&rdquo; Christian replied.
      &ldquo;But it did not attract me. The athletics here&mdash;they rather annoy me.
      It is as if people thought of nothing else. And to have students at the
      universities consumed with the idea&mdash;that is specially unpleasant to
      my mind. You must remember&mdash;I am a teacher by profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back to the Empire,&rdquo; Westland decided. &ldquo;Ever been there? Well,
      it&rsquo;s worth seeing, too&mdash;perhaps more than once. The Johnnies&rsquo;ll be
      out in extraordinary force, I&rsquo;m afraid, but then you ought to see them
      too, I suppose. It takes all sorts to make a world&mdash;and the world is
      what you&rsquo;ve come out to look at. Let me get the tickets&mdash;or, well, if
      you insist&mdash;ask for the promenade.&rdquo; It was indeed a novel spectacle,
      which smote and confused his eyes, rather than revealed itself to them,
      when Christian found himself inside. The broad, low, rounded promenade was
      so crowded with people that at first sight walking about seemed wholly
      impracticable, but Dicky stepped confidently into the jumbled throng and
      began moving through it, apparently with ease, and the other followed him.
      They made their way to the end, where a man in uniform guarded a
      staircase; then, turning, they elbowed along back to the opposite end of
      the half-circle. This gained, there was nothing in Dicky&rsquo;s thoughts,
      seemingly, but to repeat the performance indefinitely. Their progress was
      of a necessity slow. On the inner side a dense wall of backs and high hats
      rendered hopeless any notion of seeing the stage below. Christian,
      struggling after his guide, wondered what else there was to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time it became obvious to him that the women who formed so large
      an element of the lazily shifting crowd were also the occasion of its
      being. They walked about, looking the men in the face with a cold, free,
      impassive scrutiny upon which, even if he had never seen it before,
      intuition would have fixed a label for him. Other women, from the plush
      seats on the outer edge of the circle, bent upon the whole moving mass of
      promenaders the same stoical, inscrutable gaze. The range of age among
      them did not seem extended to his uninformed glance. In years they were
      apparently all about alike. Some, indeed, had fresher faces and smoother
      skins than others, but when the eyes were considered a certain indefinable
      equality was insisted upon in them all. Their toilets were often striking
      in effect, and especially their hats&mdash;exaggerating both in breadth of
      brim, and in the height and bulk of the edifice of plumes above, the
      prevalent fashion in such matters&mdash;were notable to the spectator; but
      Christian found himself, upon consideration, more interested in their eyes
      than in anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain stony quality in this stereotyped gaze of theirs suggested a
      parallel to his memory; he had seen precisely that same cool, unruffled,
      consciously unconscious stare in princesses who had looked at him without
      beholding him in the far-away days of his life about the hotels of the
      Riviera. It was very curious, he thought&mdash;this incongruous
      resemblance. But a little closer analysis showed that the likeness was but
      partial. These ladies of the promenade could look about them with the
      imperturbability of princesses, it was true, but only so long as they saw
      nothing which concerned them immediately. Nay, now he could discern
      beneath the surface of this passionless perlustration a couched vigilance
      of attention, which ever and again flashed uppermost with electric
      swiftness. When this mercurial change came, one saw the temperament mapped
      out like a landscape under the illumination of lightning. There gleamed
      forth expectancy, dread, joy, irritability, fun, dislike or wistful hope&mdash;whatever
      the mood of the instant yielded&mdash;with a force of intensity almost
      startling. Then, as quickly as it came, the look might vanish; even if it
      flickered on, the briefest interval of repose brought back again the
      watchful, dispassionate, hardened regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had enough of this?&rdquo; Dicky asked, with an implication of
      weariness in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian, halting, took slow and bewildered cognizance of the fact that
      he had been going from one end of the promenade to the other for a very
      long time. Insensibly, at some period of the experience, he had taken the
      lead from his companion, and had been dragging him about in his wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very interesting,&rdquo; was the vague excuse he offered to Dicky, and
      even more to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sofa just beside them was for the moment unoccupied. Christian seated
      himself with the air of one physically tired out. &ldquo;Ought we not to order
      drinks?&rdquo; he asked his companion, who stood over him, looking down somewhat
      doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no&mdash;not here!&rdquo; Dicky replied, with conviction. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      nearly closing time&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll go over to the club for half an hour&mdash;where
      we know our tipple. Shall we run along now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;sit down here,&rdquo; said Christian. He spoke with the authority of a
      profound emotion, that glowed in his eyes and quivered on his lips.
      Westland obeyed him, pretending to a nonchalance which his mistrustful
      glance belied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all very extraordinary to me,&rdquo; Christian continued, in a low,
      strenuous voice. He spoke with even more than his wonted fluency. &ldquo;It
      catches hold of me. It fills my mind with new thoughts. There is something
      in the very air here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Musk and cigarette smoke,&rdquo; interposed Dicky, lightly. Then he saw that
      levity struck a false note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pah!&rdquo; the other jerked forth, impatiently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that! It is
      the most terrible, the most touching, the most inspiring thing I have seen
      in my life. I breathe in a new ambition here, out of this atmosphere. We
      were talking of the London poor. I thought they made the loudest appeal&mdash;but
      they are nothing beside <i>this!</i>&rdquo; He spread his thin, nervous hand out
      as he spoke, and swept it in a comprehensive gesture over the spectacle
      before them. &ldquo;These are my sisters&mdash;my unhappy and dishonored
      sisters, scorned and scornful&mdash;oh, yes, they are all my sisters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But fortunately they don&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; urged Dicky, surveying the ladies
      with pouting lips and half-closed eyes. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t mention it
      to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian turned round, with one knee on the sofa, and claimed his
      companion&rsquo;s attention. &ldquo;I wanted to be able to add you to my very little
      list of friends,&rdquo; he said, gravely. &ldquo;All the evening I have had that in my
      mind&mdash;and it may be something else, too. But if you cannot understand
      me, now, when I tell you how all this moves me&mdash;and if you only care
      to mock at what I say&mdash;why, then, it is not needful to say more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dicky faced about in turn, and regarded him with a puzzled glance, from
      which he was at pains to exclude all signs of frivolity. &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t
      told me <i>how</i> it moves you at all,&rdquo; he said, vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how,&rdquo; repeated Christian with hesitation. &ldquo;It is not easy to say just
      how. But I am devoured by a great compassion. I could weep tears at the
      heart-misery I see here. They shout in the papers and wring their hands
      over the massacre of Armenians&mdash;but right here&mdash;this thing&mdash;is
      it not more cruel and dreadful still? Here there is no question of race
      hatreds and religious hatreds, but just the cold, implacable pressure of
      poverty on human souls, crushing them and sinking them in shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s only a part of the story&mdash;not such a deuce of a big part
      either,&rdquo; urged the other, gently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get so excited about it, my dear
      fellow. It is by no means a new thing. And wait till you know more about
      it, and have thought it over&mdash;and then, if you feel that there is
      anything you can do, why, take my word for it, it will still be here. It
      won&rsquo;t disappear in the meanwhile. You&rsquo;ll still be in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian regarded him wistfully, and with a mild, faint smile. &ldquo;You would
      never enter into my feelings about this,&rdquo; he said, softly. &ldquo;We are made
      differently. It strikes you as strange, does it not, that a young man,
      coming into contact with this for the first time, should be filled only
      with the yearning to help these poor girls, and do good to them? It
      surprises you? It is something new to you, n&rsquo;est ce pas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dicky grinned within decorous limits. &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; he declared,
      confidentially, &ldquo;so far from being new, it&rsquo;s the oldest thing in the
      world. Every young fellow worth his salt that I have ever known, or that
      anybody&rsquo;s ever known, has swelled himself out with precisely these same
      reform sentiments. In this very promenade here I have witnessed at least a
      dozen attacks like yours. And don&rsquo;t think I am jeering at the thing. It is
      a very beautiful and generous spirit indeed, and I admire it awfully, I
      assure you&mdash;only&mdash;only, as one gets to know his way about a
      trifle better, he sees that there isn&rsquo;t so much in it as he thought there
      was. And that&rsquo;s what I was trying to say to you. Don&rsquo;t let your first
      impulses run away with you. If the subject interests you, appeals to you,
      very well; get to understand it. You will find that it is more
      complicated, perhaps, than you think. But when you know it all, why, then
      you can do what you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of the light seemed to have been turned out. A definitive blare
      rolled up from the orchestra below; the throng of promenaders, though
      still informed by the most leisurely of moods, was converging upon the
      door of exit. The two young men arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian suddenly yawned. &ldquo;I am tired&mdash;and depressed,&rdquo; he said,
      wearily. &ldquo;I think I will ask you to let me go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Dicky, promptly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to the club, and get a
      pick-up, and then you shall see something that won&rsquo;t depress you. I grant
      you this <i>is</i> rather melancholy. God knows why we came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour or more later, emerging from a confusing sequence of narrow
      passages and winding ascents and descents, Christian followed Westland out
      through a groove of painted canvas to the stage of the Hanover Theater.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never seen a theater from this point of view, and the first few
      minutes of his scrutiny&mdash;here where he stood at the wings, while
      Dicky looked after the coats and hats&mdash;were full of pleased interest.
      The huge dusky space of the galleries overhead, strange and formidable in
      its dark bulk like some giant balloon, was very impressive. By contrast,
      the stage itself seemed to give out light. A long riband of a table
      stretched across the back, and down the two sides, and about this
      clustered many people; shining shirt-fronts and bald heads, pale
      shimmering dresses and white shoulders, the glitter of napery and plates
      and glasses&mdash;all was radiant under the powerful electric glow from
      above. He could see now, in the halfshadows down beyond the footlights,
      two or three rows of heads of people sitting in the front stalls. To his
      fancy these detached heads appeared to belong to an order of beings quite
      distinct from those on the stage. He wondered if actors felt their
      audiences to be thus remote and aloof from themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can push our way in at the other end&mdash;there&rsquo;s less of a crush
      there,&rdquo; he heard Dicky say to him. He followed his guide across the stage,
      through groups of conversing guests who had brought out their sandwiches
      and glasses from the throng, and came eventually to the table itself. Some
      one held out a bottle toward him, and he lifted a glass to be filled. From
      under some other stranger&rsquo;s arm he extricated a plate, containing
      something in gelatine, he knew not what. In straightening himself he
      pushed against a person unexpectedly close behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half turning, with the murmur of an apology upon his lips, his eyes
      encountered those of a lady, who seemed to know him, and to be smiling at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo; this lady said to him. There could be no doubt about the
      cordiality of her tone. Her left hand was occupied with a champagne glass
      and a fan, but her right was being lifted to him, almost against his
      breast, in greeting. He gazed at her in smiling perplexity, the while he
      signed that both his own hands were filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me from Adam,&rdquo; she said to him, cheerfully. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m your
      cousin&mdash;Cora Torr, you know.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>ou&rsquo;ve altered so
      much since I saw you! It was odds against my recognizing you at all,&rdquo;
       declared Cora, beaming forth into conversation before Christian had fairly
      grasped the significance of her identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never have believed they would make such an Englishman out of
      you, in just these few months. Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;it was October, wasn&rsquo;t it?
      Yes, of course&mdash;the First.&rdquo; She showed her beautiful teeth in a flash
      of gaiety. &ldquo;The pheasants weren&rsquo;t the only ones that got hit that day. But
      bygones are bygones.... And how do you like London? How do you find it
      compares with Paris? I always maintain that there&rsquo;s more real life here,
      if you know where to look for it.... But I am afraid you&rsquo;re not glad to
      see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are wrong. I am glad to see you,&rdquo; Christian replied, with
      deliberation. He made his words good by thrusting his plate back upon the
      table and shaking her gloved hand. There was a frank smile in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get my glass filled again,&rdquo; she suggested&mdash;&ldquo;and-your own too&mdash;and
      let&rsquo;s get out of the way. These people push as if they had had nothing to
      eat since Christmas. Of all the hogs in evening clothes, the stage-supper
      hog is the worst. Well, and how have you been, all this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had moved across the stage to the entrance, and paused near it in a
      little nook of momentary isolation. Christian made conventional answer to
      her query, and to other remarks of hers calling for no earnest attention,
      the while he concentrated his thoughts upon the fact that they were
      actually standing here together, talking like old friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was sufficiently surprising, this fact, but even more remarkable was
      the satisfaction he himself was getting from it. There was no room for
      doubt; he really enjoyed being with her. There was no special need to
      concern himself with what she was saying. She hardly paused for replies,
      and seemed not to mind in the least the automatic character of the few
      which came to her. He had only to smile a little, and nod, and let his
      eyes glow pleasurably, and she went blithely on. The perception came
      suddenly to him that he had been sorry also for her. Indeed, now that he
      reflected upon it, had not hers been the most cruel misfortune of all? The
      memory of the drawn, agonized mask of a face she had shown, over the
      tea-table in the conservatory at Caermere, rose in his mind&rsquo;s vision. He
      looked up at the strips of canvas and lamps above, with half-closed eyes,
      recalling in reverie the details of this suffering face; then he turned
      abruptly to confront her, and observe afresh the happy contrast she
      presented to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora was looking away for the instant, and apparently conveying by lifted
      eyebrows and shakes of the head a message of some sort to some person on
      the bustling stage unknown to him. He glanced instinctively in the
      direction of her signal, but gained no information&mdash;and indeed
      realized at once that he was not in search of any. Of course, she knew
      everybody here, and would be exchanging nods and smiles of recognition all
      the evening. It occurred to him to wonder if her husband, that Captain
      Edward of unpleasant memory, was on the stage, but he had the power to put
      the thought promptly out of his mind. It was only Cora that he was
      interested in, and that he wanted to talk with. And here she was, once
      more looking into his face, and restoring by her smile his almost jocund
      pleasure in the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still maintained the rôle of listener, but it grew increasingly clear
      to him that when his turn came he would have a good deal to say, and that
      he would say it well. He had never spoken on familiar terms with an
      actress before&mdash;and the experience put him wonderfully at his ease.
      He felt that he could say things to her; already he delighted in the
      assurance of her receptivity, her immunity from starched nonsense, her
      genial and comforting good fellowship. As he continued to look at her, and
      to smile, he remembered what people always said, or rather took for
      granted, about ladies on the stage. The consciousness shaped itself within
      him that she offered a timely and felicitous compromise&mdash;a sort of
      bridge between those formal, &ldquo;gun-metal&rdquo; women of society whom he desired
      never to see again, and those hapless, unblest creatures of the Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she took his arm, and they moved round to the stalls in front,
      and found seats a little apart from any one else. A large number of young
      ladies, in white or light-hued evening dresses, were seated about in the
      rows before them, and Cora pointed out this one and that among them to
      Christian. &ldquo;That is Dolly Montressor&mdash;the dancer, you know&mdash;her
      photos are all the rage just now. The girl in pink, over there&mdash;just
      turning round&mdash;she is the one who sued young Concannon for breach of
      promise. You must remember. Her lawyers put the bailiffs in for what she
      owed them, after they&rsquo;d taken everything the jury gave her, and she
      dressed the bailiffs in livery and had them wait at the table at a big
      supper she gave. The little thicknosed dark man there&mdash;next but one
      to her&mdash;he drew a check for the supper and the bailiffs too. You see
      the small, thin girl with the tomato-colored hair&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t bring
      <i>her</i> suit into court&mdash;one isn&rsquo;t fox-headed for nothing. She
      settled outside at the last minute&mdash;the Lord Carmody case, you know&mdash;and
      no one&rsquo;s ever heard a whisper of any supper she ever gave. It isn&rsquo;t at all
      her line. She puts it all into South Africans; they say she&rsquo;s good for
      thirty thousand pounds, if she&rsquo;s got a penny. It isn&rsquo;t bad, you know, on a
      salary of six quid, and only the pantomime season at that. Oh, there&rsquo;s
      Peggy Wiltshire&mdash;just in the doorway. She&rsquo;s the most remarkable woman
      in England. How old would you think she was? Forty? Why, my dear man, she
      was billed as a star in the old original Black Crook&mdash;just about the
      time I was born. She can&rsquo;t be a minute under sixty. But look at her&mdash;the
      neck and shoulders of a girl! Isn&rsquo;t it amazing! Why, she was knocking
      about town when your father was a youngster&mdash;and here she is still
      going strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tables were being cleared from the stage, and the fringe of gentlemen
      who remained hungry and thirsty was retiring slowly and with palpable
      reluctance toward the wings. Some sad-faced musicians emerged wearily from
      an unsuspected cave beneath the footlights, and exhibited their violins
      and flutes to the general gaze with an air of profound dejection. Their
      fiddle strings began to whine at one another, in a perfunctory and
      bad-tempered groping about for something they were expected to have in
      common. A stout man on the stage vigorously superintended the removal of
      the last table, and warned off with a comprehensive gesture the lingering
      remnant of unsated raveners; then, turning, he lifted his hand. On the
      instant, some score and more of the young ladies in white and pale pinks
      and blues and lavenders rose from their front stalls, and moved toward the
      stage door at the left. They pressed forward like a flock of sheep&mdash;and
      with faces as listlessly vacant as any pasture could afford. Christian
      observed their mechanical exit with a curling lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If these are the renowned beauties, whose fascinations turn the heads of
      all the young men about town,&rdquo; he confided to his companion, &ldquo;then it says
      extremely little for the quality of what is inside those heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it extraordinary!&rdquo; she mused at him, eyeing the bevy of
      celebrities with a ruminating glance. &ldquo;This must be somewhere near the
      sixth or seventh lot of &rsquo;em that even I&rsquo;ve seen passing through the
      turnstile, as you might say. Where do they all come from?&mdash;and good
      heavens! where do they all go to? It&rsquo;s a procession that never stops, you
      know. You&rsquo;d think there was a policeman, keeping it moving. You have these
      girls here&mdash;well, they&rsquo;re the queens, just for the minute. They own
      the earth. Nothing in the world is too good for them. Very well: just
      behind them are some other girls, a few years younger. Goodness knows
      where they were to-night&mdash;in the back ranks of the ballets, perhaps,
      or doing their little turn at the Paragon or the Canterbury, or doing
      nothing at all&mdash;nothing but keeping their toes pointed in this
      direction. And they are treading close on the heels of these queens you
      see here; and behind <i>them</i> are girls of sixteen or so, and behind <i>them</i>
      the little chits of ten and twelve&mdash;and they&rsquo;re all pushing along&mdash;and
      in time each lot gets in front, out under the limelight, and has its
      little year on the throne&mdash;and then gets shoved off to make room for
      the next. You might have seen two-thirds of these men here ten years ago.
      But not the women. Oh, no! Only here and there one&mdash;an old stager
      like Polly Wiltshire&mdash;or a middle-aged stager like myself. But we&rsquo;re
      merely salt to the porridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you not wish to dance?&rdquo; he asked her. The orchestra had begun a
      waltz, and the young ladies from the front stalls, each now attached to a
      stiffly gyrating male figure, were circling about on the stage, with a
      floating, wave-like swing of their full skirts which revealed to those
      below in the stalls rhythmic glimpses of whisking feet and trim black
      ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will dance with you with pleasure,&rdquo; she replied, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately&rdquo;&mdash;he began with confusion&mdash;&ldquo;it is ridiculous of
      me, but I never learned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, we will sit here and talk,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;I truly don&rsquo;t want
      to dance. It&rsquo;s ever so much cooler and more comfortable here. One has to
      come to these things, you know&mdash;you have to show yourself or you&rsquo;re
      like the man who fell out of the balloon&mdash;simply not in it. But
      they&rsquo;re all alike&mdash;all deadly stupid unless you&rsquo;re young and want to
      kick your legs about&mdash;or unless you find some one you&rsquo;re particularly
      glad to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian did not seek to evade the implication of the genial glance with
      which she pointed this last remark. &ldquo;Yes, it is good of you to stay here
      with me,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Except you and my friend who brought me here&mdash;I
      thought I saw him dancing a moment ago&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know a soul. I have
      been saying to-day,&rdquo; he continued, settling down in his seat toward her,
      &ldquo;that I make friends badly&mdash;I remain here in England almost a
      stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I thought you went everywhere. I know I&rsquo;m forever seeing your name
      in the &lsquo;Morning Post.&rsquo; You spell it Tower, I notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I have been going everywhere&mdash;but going as one goes alone
      through a gallery of pictures. I do not bring out any friends with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stole a swift glance at him, as she fanned herself. &ldquo;You surprise me,&rdquo;
       she commented. &ldquo;I should have thought everybody would be running after
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they? I am not conscious of it.&rdquo; He spoke wearily. &ldquo;If they do, it
      does not interest me. They are not my kind of people. They take no hold
      whatever upon my sympathy. They make no appeal to the imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could hardly say that about those ladies&rsquo; skirts up there,&rdquo; she
      jocosely remarked. &ldquo;I had no idea silk petticoats flapped so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not to be diverted from his theme. &ldquo;It is very funny about me,&rdquo; he
      went on. &ldquo;I seem to make no friends among men, of my own age or any other.
      Of course there are two or three exceptions&mdash;but no more. And as for
      the majority of women, they attract me still less. Yet when, once in a
      great while, I do meet some one who really interests me, it is always a
      woman. These few women whom I have in mind&mdash;oh, I could count them on
      the fingers of one hand&mdash;they make a much deeper and more lasting
      impression on me than any man can make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that frequently happens,&rdquo; she put in lightly. She did not seem
      to him to be following his thread of reasoning with conspicuous closeness,
      but her pleasant smile reassured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am most readily moved on the side of my compassion,&rdquo; he
      continued, intent upon the development of his self-analysis. &ldquo;If I am
      sorry for the people, it is easier for me to like them&mdash;that is, if
      they are young and pretty women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cora laughed aloud at this, then lapsed abruptly into thoughtfulness. &ldquo;How
      do you mean?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night I went to the place of the&mdash;the promenade&mdash;the Empire,
      is it not? And the sight of the young women there&mdash;it terribly
      affected me. I wanted to shout out that they were all my sisters&mdash;that
      I would protect them all&mdash;that they should never be forced by poverty
      and want to face that miserable humiliation again.&rdquo; She looked at him, her
      lips parted over the beautiful teeth, a certain blankness of
      non-comprehension in the beautiful eyes. As she slowly grasped the drift
      of his words, the eyes and lips joined in a reserved and baffling smile.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice boy,&rdquo; she decided, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re tremendously young. Those
      girls are lazy, greedy, good-for-nothing hussies. They wouldn&rsquo;t do honest
      work for a living if it was brought to them on a silver salver. They
      haven&rsquo;t an idea in their empty painted heads except to wheedle or steal
      money from drunken fools. They&rsquo;re nothing but&mdash;what d&rsquo;ye call &rsquo;em?&mdash;parasites.
      I&rsquo;d put &rsquo;em all on the treadmill, if I had my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian sat up a little, and she was alert in noting the signs of
      disaffection on his mobile face. &ldquo;Nevertheless, there is a great sorrow
      and a great shame in it all,&rdquo; he said, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that I admit,&rdquo; she declared, making busy work with her fan. &ldquo;Of
      course! Perhaps I spoke more sharply than I meant. Every one is sorry for
      the poor creatures&mdash;but&mdash;but I confess I&rsquo;m sorrier still for the
      girls who have to work like slaves for the barest necessities of life.
      Why, my dressmaker&rsquo;s girls, two of &rsquo;em&mdash;poor little
      half-starved sisters who may come at nine or ten o&rsquo;clock at night to
      deliver things, or try something on&mdash;they get twenty-five shillings a
      week between them. That&rsquo;s what gets on <i>my</i> nerve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He preserved silence for a time, then suddenly sat upright and faced her.
      A new light shone in his eyes. &ldquo;I am the dullest person on earth,&rdquo; he
      protested. &ldquo;All this time I have not thought of it. I want to ask you a
      thousand things about your sister. Did you not know?&mdash;She is my
      oldest friend in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cora drew a long breath, and held up her fan for a protracted and
      attentive inspection. &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;you mean Frank,&rdquo; she said,
      tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank? Is that her name? She works. She has a machine à écrire&mdash;a
      typewriter it is called. You must tell me about her! Is she very well? And
      where is she to be found? How shall I go about it to recall myself to
      her?&rdquo; As there came no immediate response, he put his further meditations
      into dreamy words: &ldquo;She spoke the first kind words to me, here in England.
      I bade farewell to France and the old hard life, in her company. It was
      she who pointed with her finger for me to have my first look at England&mdash;the
      little, rose-colored island in the green water, with the purple clouds
      above it. It seemed that we were very close together&mdash;on that one
      day. And I was so full of the thought of seeing her very soon again! And
      that was September&mdash;and now it is very nearly May!. . . But you have
      not told me! Where is it that she is to be found? Where does she live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She lives at home with my people,&rdquo; Cora replied, still with reflective
      deliberation. It was with a visible effort that she shook off the
      preoccupied air into which she had lapsed. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t want to go there&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      out of the world&mdash;red-busses and green-busses and a tram and that
      sort of thing. But she has an office now of her own; that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;d
      find her most easily. Bless me if I know where it is&mdash;it&rsquo;s between
      the Strand and the Embankment, but I never can remember which is Norfolk
      Street and which Arundel Street&mdash;and really I&rsquo;m not sure she&rsquo;s on
      either. But my brother is here. I&rsquo;ll ask him, presently. And so you know
      Frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, but you know her better still,&rdquo; said Christian, softly, nestling
      again into the corner of his chair nearest her. &ldquo;I wanted you to tell me
      about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;but what is there to tell?&rdquo; she made answer, vaguely. &ldquo;She
      is a good girl; she&rsquo;s frightfully clever; she works very hard, and gives
      most of her money to her mamma; she&rsquo;s successful, too, because she&rsquo;s got a
      shop of her own, at last&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;that&rsquo;s about all, isn&rsquo;t
      it? You know, we&rsquo;re not by way of seeing much of each other. There&rsquo;s no
      quarrel, of course&mdash;not the least in the world&mdash;but I&rsquo;m too
      frivolous to be in her class at all. I dare say it&rsquo;s my fault&mdash;I
      ought to go and look her up. That&rsquo;s what I will do, too, one of these
      days. But&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t misunderstand me&mdash;she&rsquo;s an awfully good
      girl, that is, of course, if you like that sort of girl. And she&rsquo;s pretty,
      too, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so,&rdquo; affirmed Christian, almost with solemnity. &ldquo;What time
      would she come to her office&mdash;in the morning, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t ask me!&rdquo; laughed Cora. &ldquo;At some ghastly hour, when they have
      breakfast, I believe, in cabmen&rsquo;s shelters, and the streets haven&rsquo;t been
      swept. I know it only by hearsay. I&rsquo;ve never stopped up quite as late as
      that, you know. But you see something like it, driving round by Covent
      Garden on your way home from a late dance, to see the flowers. Have you
      ever done that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian shook his head. The idea attracted him, apparently. &ldquo;At what
      hour is it?&rdquo; he asked, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, four or five or something like that. It&rsquo;s really the prettiest sight
      you ever saw. I used to go often, at this time of year, and take home a
      cabload of flowers. But I am getting too old now&mdash;and too
      serious-minded. The mother of a family&mdash;you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian looked at his watch. &ldquo;It has occurred to me&rdquo;&mdash;he suggested,
      hesitatingly&mdash;&ldquo;it is now after two&mdash;perhaps we could make a
      party to go this morning. The dancing will not stop earlier, will it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the stage nothing seemed further from any mind than stopping. There was
      some complicated kind of set dance in progress, which at the moment
      involved the spectacle of some score of couples, hands all joined, romping
      madly around in a gigantic ring. The dresses whirled more wildly than
      ever; the men crooked their legs and hung outward from the circle as they
      went, stamping their feet and laughing boisterously. Christian&rsquo;s eyes
      singled out one young man who seemed to be making most noise of all&mdash;and
      then he perceived that it was Dicky Westland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it might be arranged,&rdquo; Cora replied, after consideration, and
      with a sidelong eye upon her companion. &ldquo;I will go behind for a moment,
      and find my brother, and see what he says. No, you stop here. I will come
      back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So many people were moving about with entire individual freedom, that he
      offered no objection to her departure. She pushed her way confidently yet
      affably past the others in the row, and disappeared at the stage door. He
      had no clues by which to follow her in fancy after that. Once he thought
      he distinguished her at the back of the stage&mdash;but for the rest it
      was her sister rather than the friendly Cora who engaged his thoughts. The
      idea that he was to see her again, quite without delay, seemed to
      illuminate his whole mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the labyrinth of shunted scenery behind the back-curtain, and along the
      narrow corridors of dressing-rooms, now devoted to varying hospitable
      uses, Cora prosecuted what was for a time a fruitless search.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the gentlemen getting their drinks?&rdquo; she asked at last of a
      cloak-room attendant, and the answer simplified her task. Downstairs, at
      the door of the manager&rsquo;s room, she was lucky enough to hit upon Major
      Pirie. &ldquo;Tell Eddy that&rsquo; I want him, will you, old man,&rdquo; she said, nodding
      with assurance toward the crowded, smoky little interior, &ldquo;and if that
      brother of mine is in there, I want to see him for a minute, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brother came out first&mdash;a slender, overdressed youth, with a face
      which suggested a cheap and inferior copy of Cora&rsquo;s. It had the
      self-complacency without the high spirits&mdash;the comeliness of line
      without the delicacy of texture and charm of color. He was obviously young
      in years, but he regarded her through the eyes of an elderly and wearied
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said, amiably enough. &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to take Eddy home? He won&rsquo;t be
      the worse for a friendly lead. Oh, he&rsquo;s all right, though, up to now. He&rsquo;s
      got rippin&rsquo; odds against Perambulator from Hoskins, seventy to three, you
      know, in fivers. Try and get him to let me in on the bet, will you? I
      offered to take half of it, the minute the bet was made&mdash;but he
      didn&rsquo;t answer me. You can work it, if you try, old girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Frank&rsquo;s address&mdash;her office, I mean?&rdquo; she put in abruptly,
      &ldquo;Got a pencil? Go and get one from somebody. Thirty-two A, you say?
      Thanks! Now tell Eddy to come out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s up? What do you want with Frank? Anything I can tell her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind! And don&rsquo;t lisp a word to her, or to Eddy or to any one
      else. If it comes off, it&rsquo;ll be a beano for the lot of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; he assented, with a glimmer of animation. &ldquo;But say, you
      won&rsquo;t forget about the Hoskins bet, will you? If I could even have a third
      of it! I could do with some odd sovereigns just now, and no mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh-h! Here he comes. You run away-now, d&rsquo;ye see; I want to talk with
      Eddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Edward emerged from the haze of cigarette smoke which veiled the
      throng within the manager&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he demanded, with a kind of
      sulky eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told him you were here,&rdquo; Cora began, under her breath, drawing
      her husband aside down the passage. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t seem to come into the talk.
      He thinks I&rsquo;m here with Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edward looked down upon his wife, with a slow, ponderous glance of mingled
      hope and uneasiness. He pulled at his small yellow mustache, and aimlessly
      jingled some keys in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had nearly two hours with him, you know,&rdquo; he protested,
      doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i> I know it!&rdquo; she ejaculated, holding up her hands in mock
      pain at the retrospect. &ldquo;Good God! If I had a thousand pounds to show for
      it, I&rsquo;d say it was the hardest earned money <i>I</i> ever handled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you haven&rsquo;t got anything to show&mdash;so far&rsquo;s I can make out,&rdquo;
       he commented with gloom. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mention my name at all, eh? But that
      was what you particularly set out to do, I thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you thought wrong,&rdquo; she responded briskly. &ldquo;I set out to do what
      was wisest under the circumstances, and I&rsquo;ve done it. I&rsquo;ve got an inkling
      of a game to be played&rdquo;&mdash;she let her eyes twinkle at him as she made
      this tantalizing little pause&mdash;&ldquo;a game, you old goose, worth seven
      hundred thousand times anything you ever thought of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ex-hussar regarded her fixedly, the while he pondered her words. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m very keen about games,&rdquo; he remarked at last, with obvious
      suspicion in his tone. &ldquo;A married woman always gets the worst of games, in
      the long run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She grinned affectionate contempt up at him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a duffer,
      Eddy!&rdquo; she remonstrated with him. &ldquo;If I had a notion of that sort&mdash;do
      you suppose I&rsquo;d come and give it away to you? What rot you talk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but what <i>is</i> your game?&rdquo; he demanded, doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell you!&rdquo; She spoke with great apparent decision. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d blab it
      all over the place. You can no more keep a secret than you can keep a
      ten-pound note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, Cora,&rdquo; he urged, in grieved protestation. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m a
      regular bailey oyster, where a thing has to be kept dark. You&rsquo;d better
      tell me, you know. It&rsquo;ll keep me from&mdash;imaginin&rsquo; things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wife smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a plant I&rsquo;ve got in my mind,&rdquo; she explained,
      after consideration. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with my naming a wife for him,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edward, upon reflection, pouted his lips. &ldquo;Probably you&rsquo;d come a cropper
      over it, in the first place,&rdquo; he objected, slowly, &ldquo;and then even if you
      did name the winner, she&rsquo;d probably welsh us out of our winnings&mdash;and
      besides, what do we want of his marrying at all. The longer he puts off
      getting married, the less the odds against us gets. I should think even a
      woman could see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cora permitted herself a frank yawn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain it to you to-morrow,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I must go back to my Juggins for a few minutes. I&rsquo;ll come and
      fetch you when I&rsquo;m ready to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy it much, you know,&rdquo; he urged upon her as she turned. He
      took a step toward her, and put his hand on her arm. &ldquo;If your brother Tom
      was any good&rdquo;&mdash;he began, with a hard growl in his voice&mdash;&ldquo;by
      God, I&rsquo;d have half a mind to talk with him about <i>my</i> plan. Old
      Pirie&rsquo;d be no use&mdash;but if Tom had the sense and the nerve&mdash;why,
      we&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had held his eye with a steady, comprehending glance, under the
      embarrassment of which his speech faltered and then lapsed altogether.
      &ldquo;No, the less either you or Tom have to do with your plan the better. Go
      in now, and take a plain soda, and wait for me! You&rsquo;ve got no plan, mind
      you. You&rsquo;ve simply been dreaming about it. Do you hear? You never had a
      plan! You can&rsquo;t have one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with significant authority, and he deferred to it with a sullen
      upward wag of the head. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he muttered curtly, and turned on his
      heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plain soda, mind!&rdquo; she called after him, and without waiting for an
      answer, ran briskly up the steps toward the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Edward&rsquo;s plain soda had become a remote and almost wholly effaced
      memory by the time his wife again summoned him from the manager&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cut this now, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she remarked, in her most casual
      tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as tired as if I&rsquo;d danced every minute.&rdquo; She had put on her
      wraps, and her small, pretty face, framed by the white down of her hood,
      seemed to his scrutiny to wear an expression of increased contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything fresh?&rdquo; he asked, as they went in search of his coat and hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;fresh is the word,&rdquo; she replied, with simulated nonchalance.
      &ldquo;Fresh, fresher, freshest&mdash;as we used to say at school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha&rsquo; is it?&rdquo; he inquired, when they were within touch of the open air.
      The music was still audible behind them, broken by faint, intermittent
      echoes of stamping feet and laughing voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about it in the morning,&rdquo; she answered listlessly. &ldquo;I hope
      to heaven you&rsquo;ve got a cab-fare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, tha&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Edward, waving his stick toward the rank in
      the dark middle distance of the street. &ldquo;Whyn&rsquo;t you tell me all about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you wouldn&rsquo;t get onto it now,&rdquo; she replied, But later, in the hansom,
      the desire to unburden her mind achieved the mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you awake?&rdquo; she demanded, and went on: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a bad sort, that
      boy, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn him!&rdquo; said Edward, breathing heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather like him myself,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bit slow to talk to,
      and he&rsquo;s fresher than Devonshire cream, but there isn&rsquo;t a drop of the
      Johnnie in him. He&rsquo;s as clean as my little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn him,&rdquo; repeated her husband, but in a milder and even argumentative
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a proper bundle of nerves, that youngster,&rdquo; she mused, as if talking
      to herself. &ldquo;And whatever those nerves of his tell him to do, he&rsquo;ll do it.
      And I&rsquo;d lay odds he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to surprise us all. He&rsquo;s got something boilin&rsquo;
      in his mind&mdash;something that&rsquo;s just struck him to-night&mdash;I could
      see that. Oh, if I was a man!&mdash;I&rsquo;d get out of this hansom now, and
      I&rsquo;d follow that lad, and I&rsquo;d get hold of him somehow, and I&rsquo;d bend him any
      way I chose&mdash;<i>that</i> would be something like!&mdash;but then
      again, you take him some other way, and he&rsquo;s as stubborn as a moke. But I
      like him, all the same.&rdquo; She turned toward her husband, and lifted her
      voice a little. &ldquo;I like him so much, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; of havin&rsquo; him for a
      brother-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strornary thing,&rdquo; commented Edward, earnestly, &ldquo;no man&rsquo;er where I start
      from, whenever I get t&rsquo; the Circus, I get the hiccups.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cora put her head back against the cushions, and closed her eyes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>hristian
      discovered that he was not sorry to be alone. Cora&rsquo;s company had been
      amusing and vivifying, no doubt, but it was even better now to have his
      own thoughts. He observed with relief that others in the stalls were
      smoking; tobacco as a rule had not very much meaning for him, but now he
      lit a large cigar from the dinner-case in his pocket, and stretching
      himself in his chair, proceeded to enjoy it. He kept his glance, in an
      indolent fashion, upon the stage, but his mind roamed far and wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora, in returning to explain that it would not be possible for her to
      stay till the time for Covent Garden, had ingenuously sat on for nearly
      another hour, cheering him with her lively prattle. She asked him many
      questions about himself, his diversions, his tastes, his relations with
      Lord Julius and Emanuel. He wondered now if these queries had been quite
      as artless as they seemed at the time. There rose up before him, in
      retrospect, certain occasional phases of her manner which suggested
      something furtive. She had watched the stage, and the doorway leading from
      it, with a kind of detached uneasiness on which he now languidly
      speculated. It occurred to him again to wonder if her husband was really
      in the building. Christian found himself thinking of this cousin of his
      almost with compassion. Poor devil! Was his fate not even more tragic than
      that of the others who were merely dead? He regretted now that he had not
      asked Cora point-blank as to his presence. His mood was so tolerant
      to-night that even the unforgivable insult to his father lost its sharp
      outlines, and became only a hasty phrase, the creature of imperative
      provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her final leave-taking, Cora had genially proffered her services if he
      desired to know any or all of the young ladies&mdash;and he had begged to
      be excused. Dicky Westland came down to the stalls later on, and
      shamefacedly linked a similar offer to his apologies for his prolonged
      neglect of his guest. But Christian protested that he was enjoying himself
      thoroughly. He was never less sleepy in his life; he did not want a drink;
      he would not dream of wishing to go until his friend was entirely ready.
      &ldquo;You cannot realize,&rdquo; he concluded, with his persuasive smile, &ldquo;how
      strange and interesting this all is to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when Dicky had returned again to the stage, Christian paid less
      attention than ever to the diverting spectacle. His thoughts reverted
      obstinately to Captain Edward&mdash;? and to that portion of the family of
      which he was the congenital type. Was not that really the sort of man who
      should have the title? There seemed a cloud of negative reasons, but were
      these not sentimental abstractions? Should the duke not be a rough, hard
      sportsman, a man with a passion for horses and dogs and gunpowder
      saturating his veins? One who loved the country for its rude, toilsome
      out-of-door sports, and who liked best in town the primitive amusements of
      the natural man? He figured Edward in his mind&rsquo;s eye most readily as
      puffing and cursing over a rat-hole with his terriers&mdash;or as watching
      with a shine of steel in his blue eyes the blood-stained progress of a
      prize-fight. And truly, were these not the things that a duke of
      Glastonbury of right belonged to?
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not think of Lord Julius and of Emanuel as being Torrs at all.
      The older man had the physical inheritance of the family, it was true, but
      he was almost as much estranged from its ideals as that extraordinary son
      of his. They both were grotesquely out of the picture of English
      aristocratie life, whether in country or town. And he himself&mdash;how
      absolutely he also was out of the picture!
    </p>
    <p>
      The immensity of the position which his grandfather&rsquo;s death would devolve
      upon him had been present in his mind, it seemed sleeping as well as
      waking, for half a year. At the outset he had thrilled at the prospect;
      sometimes still he was able to reassure himself about it, and to profess
      to himself confidence that when the emergency came, he would be equal to
      it. But more often, in these latter days, the outlook depressed him. Of
      course nothing grievous would happen to him, in any event. He would be
      assured of an excellent living to the end of his days, with an exceptional
      amount of social deference from those about him, and relative freedom to
      do what he liked. He could marry and rear a family of lords and ladies; he
      could have his speeches in the House of Lords or elsewhere printed in the
      &ldquo;Times&rdquo;; if he looked about in America, he could secure a bride with
      perhaps millions to her dower. There was, in any case, the reasonable
      likelihood that he would be, to some extent, the heir of Lord Julius and
      Emanuel, in the latter part of his life. Thus he could go on, when he set
      himself to the task, piling-up reasons why he ought to view the future
      with buoyant serenity&mdash;to count himself among the happiest of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then&mdash;was his not all self-deception? Did he not know in his
      heart that he was not happy?&mdash;that this gilded and ornate career
      awaiting him really repelled all his finer senses? To-night as he followed
      his thoughts behind the transparent screen of whisking dresses and jolting
      figures upon which his outer vision rested, the impulse to escape the
      whole thing rose strong within him. Already he had sworn that he would no
      longer weary himself with the meaningless and distasteful routine of
      social obligations in London. Why should he not plunge boldly forward
      beyond that, and say that he would make no further sacrifices of any sort
      to the conventions of mediocrity?
    </p>
    <p>
      He lit another cigar and, rising, walked about a little by himself at the
      side of the stalls, his hands deep in his pockets, his brows knitted in
      formative introspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, it was clear that Emanuel&rsquo;s hopes about his taking up the
      System were doomed. It was not in him to assume such a part. He had not
      the capacity for such work; even if he had, he lacked both the tremendous
      driving energy and the enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Emanuel learned this, then he would be angry, and he would cover
      over no more money to that account at the bank. Eh bien! It couldn&rsquo;t be
      helped. Christian recalled that he had still at that blessed bank more
      than sixty thousand francs!&mdash;truly a prodigious sum, when one thought
      of it soberly. The question whether this sum ought not to be given back to
      Emanuel, under certain circumstances, seemed to have settled itself. When
      it had first occurred to him that afternoon, it had suggested a good many
      moral difficulties. But it was really simplicity itself, as he considered
      it now. There were all those lean and poverty-stricken years of his youth
      and childhood to be remembered&mdash;and, stretching back beyond that,
      those other years of his father&rsquo;s exile before he was born&mdash;nearly
      forty in all. The intelligent thing was to regard the three thousand
      pounds as a sort of restitution fund, to be spread out over the whole of
      that long period. Viewed in this light, the annual fraction of it was a
      paltry matter. Besides, Emanuel had expressly declared that no conditions
      whatever were attached to the money. Christian saw that he could make his
      mind quite easy on that score.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then, there were sixty thousand francs! With that he might live
      admirably, even luxuriously, on the Continent, until his grandfather&rsquo;s
      death. That event would of course alter everything. There would then come
      automatically to him&mdash;no matter where he was or what he did&mdash;a
      certain fixed income, which he understood to be probably over rather than
      under seventy-five thousand francs a year. This&mdash;still on the
      Continent&mdash;would be almost incredible wealth! There was really no
      limit to the soul-satisfying possibilities it opened before him. He would
      have a yacht on the Mediterranean; he would have a little chateau in the
      marvelous green depths of the Styrian Mountains&mdash;of which a boyhood
      friend had told him with such tender reverence of memory. He would see
      Innsbruck and Moscow, and, if he liked, even Samarkand and China. Why, he
      could go round the world in his yacht, if he chose&mdash;to remote spice
      islands and tropical seas! He could be a duke when, and as much, as it
      pleased him to be one. Instead of being the slave to his position and
      title, he would make them minister to him. He would do original things&mdash;realize
      his own inner fancies and predilections. If the whim seized him to climb
      Mount Ararat, or to cross the Sahara with a caravan of his own servants&mdash;that
      he would do. But above all things&mdash;now and henceforth forever, he
      would be a free man! He laughed grimly as he thought how slight was the
      actual difference between the life of pauper bondage he had led up to last
      October, and the existence which polite England and London had imposed
      upon him ever since. The second set of chains were of precious metal&mdash;that
      was all. Well, hereafter there would be no fetters of any description!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite ready to go now, old man, if you are,&rdquo; Dicky Westland said at
      some belated stage of this reverie. He had approached without being seen
      by his friend, and he had to pull at Christian&rsquo;s sleeve to attract his
      attention. &ldquo;I fancy you&rsquo;ve been walking in your sleep,&rdquo; he laughed, in
      comment upon this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian shook himself, and, blinking at Dicky, protested that he had
      never been more wide awake in his life. &ldquo;I go only if you&rsquo;re entirely
      ready,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dream of leaving on my account I have been
      extremely interested, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every fellow has his own notions of enjoyment,&rdquo; reflected Westland, with
      drowsy philosophy, as they went up the stairs toward the stage. &ldquo;I tried
      to explain your point of view to some of the girls up here, but I&rsquo;m not
      sure they quite grasped it. They were dying to have me bring you up and
      make you dance, you know. By George, I had a job to keep Dolly Montressor
      from coming down and fetching you, off her own bat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should they know or care about me?&rdquo; asked Christian. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect
      to be pointed out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear man,&rdquo; retorted Dicky, sleepily, &ldquo;no one pointed you out. They all
      know you by sight as well as they do George Edwards. It isn&rsquo;t too late,
      still, you know&mdash;if you really would like to be introduced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian shook his head with resolution, as they halted at the wings.
      &ldquo;Truly, no!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;But I should like a glass of wine and a
      sandwich, if we can get past the stage. I&rsquo;m not an atom sleepy, but I&rsquo;m
      hungry and thirsty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On their way through a narrow, shadowed defile of huge canvas-stretched
      frames of deal, they passed two young men, one much taller than the other,
      who had their heads bent together in some low-voiced, private
      conversation. Christian glanced at them casually, and was struck with the
      notion that they observed him in turn, and exchanged comment upon his
      approach. He looked at them with a keener scrutiny as he went by&mdash;and
      it seemed to him that there was something familiar in the face of the
      larger man&mdash;who indeed looked away upon the instant their eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see those men?&rdquo; he asked Westland, in an undertone, a moment
      later. &ldquo;Do you know them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those we just passed?&rdquo; Dicky looked over his shoulder. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the
      thin chap, but the other fellow is Gus Torr&mdash;why, of course&mdash;your
      cousin. Somehow, I never think of you as belonging to that lot&mdash;I
      mean, being related to them. Of course&mdash;that was his sister-in-law
      you were sitting with. Why did you ask if I knew him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;I was not sure if it was he&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen him only once,&rdquo;
       Christian replied, with an assumption of indifference. &ldquo;I remember having
      noticed then how much he looked like his brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;poor devils!&rdquo; commented Dicky, as they entered the manager&rsquo;s
      room. Apparently it was in his mind to say more, but the place was
      crowded, and the problem of getting through the throng to the food and
      drink monopolized his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes later, while Christian stood in another corridor, waiting for
      his friend to bring their hats and coats from the mysteriously elusive
      spot where he had left them, he overheard the mention of his name. Two
      women&rsquo;s voices, wholly unknown to him, came from behind an improvised
      partition of screens near at hand, with great distinctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them said: &ldquo;He spells his name &lsquo;Tower,&rsquo; you know. I understand the
      idea is to make people forget who his father was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good job, too!&rdquo; replied the other voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian turned abruptly, and strode off in the direction whither Dicky
      had disappeared. &ldquo;After forty years!&rdquo; he murmured hotly to himself. &ldquo;After
      forty years!&rdquo; and clenched his fists till the nails hurt his palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young men walked homeward, arm in arm, through silent streets over
      which the dawn was spreading its tentative first lights. It was colder
      than they had thought, and the morning air was at once misty and fresh. In
      Leicester Square the scent of lilacs came to them; beside the pale,
      undefined bulk of the squat statue they caught the lavender splash of
      color which was sister to the perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, it&rsquo;s spring!&rdquo; said Dicky. He pointed out the flowers, and then,
      still drawing Christian&rsquo;s arm to turn his attention to the square,
      recalled to him as they moved that this was the oldtime haunt of
      foreigners in London. &ldquo;Dickens&rsquo;s villain in &lsquo;Little Dorrit,&rsquo; you know&mdash;the
      fellow whose mustache went up and his nose went down&mdash;I never can
      remember his name&mdash;he lived here. In those days, all that sort of
      chappies lived here&mdash;the adventurers and jailbirds who had made their
      own countries too hot to hold them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Westland&rsquo;s insistence upon this theme had no purpose other than to divert
      Christian&rsquo;s attention while they passed the Empire. He was tired, and
      profoundly disinclined to any renewal of the discussion about the
      promenade. He encountered with vague surprise, therefore, the frowning
      glance which Christian, half halting, bent upon him. The young man&rsquo;s
      displeasure was marked, but Dicky for the life of him could not imagine
      why. He tightened his hold on the other&rsquo;s arm and quickened their pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Christian, after a few yards, suddenly withdrew his arm altogether. &ldquo;I
      do not like to walk so fast,&rdquo; he said, with a sharp note in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dicky regarded him with puzzled apprehension. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, old man?&rdquo; he
      asked, almost pleadingly. &ldquo;Has anything gone wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian, still with knitted brows, parted his lips to speak. Then he
      seemed to reconsider his intention, and let his face soften as he paused.
      &ldquo;No&mdash;nothing at all,&rdquo; he replied, after a moment. He smiled a little
      to reassure the other. &ldquo;It was nothing at all,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Only I am
      nervous and excited to-night&mdash;this morning, I should say&mdash;and my
      head is full of projects. It is twelve hours since you came to me&mdash;and
      the whole world has changed meanwhile. I see everything different. I am
      not altered to your eyes&mdash;but none the less, I am not at all, in any
      respect, the man you took to dine with you. You have not observed anything&mdash;but
      it is a revolution that has occurred under your very nose, Mr. Dicky
      Westland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too sleepy to observe anything,&rdquo; the other declared. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell
      a revolution from a&mdash;from a hot-potato can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The comparison had forced itself upon Westland&rsquo;s jaded mind through the
      medium of his weary eyes. There before them, by the curb at the corner,
      stood the dingy wheeled-oven of the streets, the sullen red glow of its
      lower door making a strange patch of fiery light upon the ragged trousers
      of the man in charge. He was a dirty and undersized creature, and he
      looked up at the two young gentlemen in evening dress with a speculative,
      yet hardly hopeful, eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian stopped short. &ldquo;Ah, this is very good,&rdquo; he said, with a
      brightening face. &ldquo;I have never eaten a potato from a can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dicky sighed, but resigned himself with only a languid protest: &ldquo;You have
      to eat so much else besides the potato,&rdquo; he commented dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man opened an upper door, and then drew from under the machine a
      twisted wad of old newspaper, which, being unwound, revealed a gray heap
      of salt. &ldquo;How many, cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo; he demanded, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian had been glancing across the Circus meanwhile&mdash;to where, in
      the misty vagueness of dawn, Piccadilly opened between its tall, shapely
      corners, and beyond, the curved yellowish sweep of Regent Street began.
      The dim light revealed some lurking figures to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you call over those women?&rdquo; he asked the potato-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall, fresh-faced young policeman came upon the group round the
      Criterion corner. Although the pounding of his thick boots on the pavement
      had been audible long before his appearance, he regarded them with the
      slightly dramatic air of one who has deftly surprised a group of
      conspirators. The potato-man looked from Christian to the officer and made
      no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian drew some silver from his pocket, shaking off the restraining
      hand Westland tried to lay on his arm. &ldquo;Is there any objection,
      constable,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;to my buying potatoes for those friends of ours
      over there? It is a cold morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The policeman&rsquo;s glance ranged from the white ties of the young gentlemen
      to the coins in Christian&rsquo;s palm. His official expression relaxed. &ldquo;I dare
      say it&rsquo;ll do no &rsquo;arm, sir,&rdquo; he replied with courtesy. He even lent
      himself to the enterprise by stooping down and beating a certain number of
      strokes with his baton on the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many times did he strike?&rdquo; Dicky made whispered inquiry. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
      new dodge to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      New or old, it was efficient. Forlorn shapes began to emerge from the
      shadows of the big streets opposite, and move forward across the empty
      open space. Others stole noiselessly in from the byways of Leicester
      Square. There were perhaps a dozen in all when the potato-man made his
      census&mdash;poorly dressed, fagged, bold-faced, furtive-eyed women. They
      spoke in monotonous, subdued tones among themselves. There were to be
      heard German, French, Belgian French, cockney English, and Lancashire
      English. Two of them pulled at the sleeve of the potato-man to make him
      hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian, regarding his motley guests, found himself neither touched nor
      entertained. They seemed as stupid as they were squalid. With a gesture of
      decision he gave the money to the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pay for it all,&rdquo; he directed, &ldquo;and if more come, give them a look-in, too&mdash;and
      keep what is left for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, Frenchy!&rdquo; broke in the constable, sharply. &ldquo;Mind what you&rsquo;re
      at! Pass Germany the salt!&rdquo; With an abrupt change to civility, he turned
      to Christian. &ldquo;Right you are, sir!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dicky laughed drowsily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the Concert of Europe,&rdquo; he declared.
      &ldquo;Shall we go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They moved down the broad pavement, again arm in arm, breathing in slowly
      the new, keen air, and observing in a silence which was full of tacit
      comment the beautiful termination of the street before them: the dark
      figures of the Crimean monument standing in grim relief against the
      morning light, the stately palace beyond, with its formal portals of club
      buildings, its embowered statues, its huge column towering ponderously
      above the pale green of spring in the park&mdash;all gray and cool and, as
      it were, thoughtfully solemn in the hush of daybreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;this wonderful London!&rdquo; sighed Christian, as they halted at
      the Continental corner. He spread his hand to embrace the prospect before
      them. &ldquo;How right you were! I have not learned to know it at all. But I
      begin now! If you will walk through the square with me&mdash;there is
      something I wish to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This something did not get itself said till they halted within this
      somber, slate-colored square. Christian paused before a big, pretentious
      house of gloomy, and even forbidding aspect&mdash;a front of sooty stucco,
      with cornices of ashen-hued stone, and many windows masked with sullen
      brown shades.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was our town house a hundred years ago,&rdquo; he said meditatively. &ldquo;My
      father was born here. My grandfather sold it when the entail was broken.
      Until this afternoon, it was my fixed resolve to buy it back again. I said
      always to myself: &lsquo;If I am to have a house in London, it must be this old
      one of ours in St. James&rsquo;s.&rsquo; But that is all changed now. At least, it is
      no longer a resolve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dicky gazed at him with sleepy eyes. &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; he asked,
      perfunctorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake up now, and I will tell you!&rdquo; Christian, with a lingering glance, as
      of renunciation, at the mansion, began to walk again. &ldquo;This is it. You
      said you were eager to be some colonial official&rsquo;s secretary&mdash;to have
      three hundred pounds&mdash;and the yellow fever. To obtain this, you
      expend all your energies, you and your relations. Well, then&mdash;why
      will you not be my secretary instead? You shall have more than three
      hundred pounds&mdash;and no yellow fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Westland had roused himself, and looked inquiringly now into the other&rsquo;s
      face. &ldquo;What do you need of a secretary?&rdquo; he objected, half jestingly. &ldquo;If
      you want to talk about it after you&rsquo;ve come into the thing&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      say that I shouldn&rsquo;t be glad-to consider it. But the deuce of it is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I wish it to begin now, this morning, this hour&mdash;this
      minute!&rdquo; Christian spoke peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dicky, pondering, shook his head. &ldquo;No, you mustn&rsquo;t insist on settling
      anything now,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t regular, you know. If you&mdash;really&mdash;want
      to propose something immediate&mdash;why, I&rsquo;ll call and talk with you
      to-morrow&mdash;or, that is to say, this afternoon. But I couldn&rsquo;t
      possibly let you commit yourself to anything of that sort now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian frowned at his friend. &ldquo;You speak of what you will let me do!&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your opinion&mdash;I see it!&mdash;you think I have not sober command
      of myself, am not responsible&mdash;is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! I&rsquo;ve said nothing of the sort,&rdquo; protested the other. &ldquo;Of
      course, you&rsquo;re perfectly all right&mdash;but we&rsquo;re both tired and sleepy,
      and you&rsquo;re not so accustomed to go home by daylight as I am&mdash;and it
      wouldn&rsquo;t be at all the thing for me to close a bargain with you now. Can&rsquo;t
      you see what I mean? I wouldn&rsquo;t play threepenny écarté with you at this
      hour in the morning&mdash;and I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;m going to let you in for
      three hundred a year for the rest of my life. Shall I come round, say, at
      luncheon time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not be in,&rdquo; said Christian, curtly. He looked at his companion,
      and then past him at the trees in the square, in vexed rumination. &ldquo;What I
      have it in my mind to do&rdquo;&mdash;he continued, vaguely, after a pause&mdash;&ldquo;it
      is not a thing for delay. It is in my blood to do it at once. It was my
      impulse to make you my comrade in it&mdash;but of course, since you have
      your reservations and doubts, there need be nothing more said about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shrug of the shoulders which emphasized these last words nettled
      Westland, and at the same time helped him to repress his annoyance. It
      lent to the whole episode just that savor of foreign eccentricity which
      appealed to the amiable tolerance of the islander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear man,&rdquo; he urged, gently, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest notion what it
      is that you&rsquo;re so keen about&mdash;but whatever it is, do go home and
      sleep on it, and make up your mind calmly after breakfast. It&rsquo;s no good
      deciding important questions, and striking out new lines, and all that
      sort of thing, at this hour in the morning. Nobody ever does it, you know.
      It simply can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; said Christian, proffering his hand. &ldquo;You are right; it is
      high time for those who are sleepy to go to bed I won&rsquo;t drag you round to
      Duke Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dicky looked at him doubtfully. &ldquo;You do wrong to be angry, you know,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is your error&mdash;I am not in the least angry&mdash;I beg you
      to believe it,&rdquo; cried Christian. His eyes beamed genially in proof of his
      assertion, and he put heartiness into his voice. &ldquo;For a minute I was
      disappointed&mdash;shall I say vexed?&mdash;but not any more. How should I
      quarrel with you for not beholding things through my eyes? To me,
      something is a giant; you perceive that it is a windmill. Eh bien! We do
      not convince each other&mdash;but surely we do not quarrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am game enough to play Sancho to your Don,&rdquo; expostulated Dicky,
      with a readiness which Christian had not looked for, &ldquo;but I draw the line
      at starting out on an empty stomach, and when we&rsquo;re too sleepy to stand.
      Well, what shall it be?&rdquo; He took the hand offered him, and strove to
      signify by his cordial grasp that no trace of a misunderstanding remained.
      &ldquo;Shall I look you up, say, at two o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think I shall be there. Goodnight!&rdquo; responded Christian, and the
      two parted.

      the stairs at Duke Street, and let himself into his apartments, with
      painstaking precautions against being overheard. There was an excess of
      zeal about Falkner which might easily impel him to present himself for
      service at even this most unseasonable hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man had still only formless notions of what he was going to do,
      but it was at least plain to him that Falkner was to have no part in the
      proceedings. He drew off his varnished boots as a further measure of
      security, and then, with more hesitation, removed his cloak and coat, and
      raised the inside blinds at the two windows. This sitting-room of his had
      rather pleased him formerly. He could recall having taken quite an
      affectionate interest in buying and arranging the rugs and pictures and
      bookcases with which he had supplemented the somewhat gaunt furnishing of
      his predecessor. But now, in this misty and reluctant light of the London
      morning, nothing seemed good to him as he looked about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pretty things of his own selection said no more to him than did the
      chattels he had taken over from a stranger. There was no spirit of home in
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved noiselessly to the adjoining bedroom, and drew the curtains there
      as well, and glanced round. Here, too, he had the sense of beholding the
      casual appointments of a hotel chamber. Nothing made an appeal of intimacy
      to him. He reflected that in a day or two he should not be able to
      remember how his room looked&mdash;even if his memory attempted the
      fatuous task. Duke Street had been engraved on his cards for six months,
      but it had not made the faintest mark on his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an air of decision, he suddenly began to drag forth his clothes from
      the wardrobe and drawers, and spread them on the bed. In the tiny
      dressing-room beyond were piled his traveling bags, and these he brought
      out into the light. Upon consideration, however, the original impulse to
      take a good many things weakened and dwindled. To begin with, their secret
      removal was in no way practicable. Moreover, now that he thought of it, he
      did not want them. They would be simply encumbrances. He would take with
      him only the smallest handbag, with a change of linen and a few brushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the conviction that even this must be a nuisance became clear to
      him, and he desisted from the random packing he had begun. Still moving
      about as silently as possible, he changed his ceremonial tie for one of
      every-day wear, and put on a suit of sober-colored tweeds, and his easiest
      brown boots. The transfer of his watch, some loose gold and the roll of
      notes from one set of pockets to another, completed his preparations in
      the bedchamber. He tiptoed out to the larger room, and there, upon
      reflection, wrote a few lines for Falkner&rsquo;s direction, saying merely that
      he was called away, and that matters were to go on as usual until he
      returned or sent further orders. He separated a banknote from the roll to
      place inside this note, but on second thoughts wrote a check instead, and
      sealing and directing the envelope, laid it in a conspicuous place on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed then, for the first time, that there were some letters from the
      evening post for him, neatly arranged on this table. He opened the
      nearest, and glanced at its contents: it was a note from his second
      cousin, Lady Milly Poynes, the fair-haired, fair-faced, fair-brained,
      fair-everything sister of Lord Lingfield, reminding him that she was
      depending upon his escort for the Private View of the Academy, and that
      the time for getting tickets was running very short. He laughed aloud at
      the conceit of the Royal Academy rising in his path as an obstacle at such
      a moment&mdash;and without more ado thrust this with the unopened letters
      into his pocket. Then, when he had made sure once more that he had his
      check-book, nothing remained to be done. He went softly forth, without so
      much as a thought of taking a farewell glance behind him, found a soft
      dark hat in the hallway and then closed the outer door with great care
      upon the whole Duke Street episode of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not to see me here again in a hurry,&rdquo; he confided aloud to the
      banisters and steps, when he had descended to the first floor. Then he
      laughed to himself, and tripped gaily down the remaining flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no hesitation now in his mood. He walked briskly back through
      the square, and then down Waterloo Place, till he came to the Guards&rsquo;
      Memorial. He moved round this to the front, and looked up at one of the
      three bronze Guardsmen with the confident air of familiarity. He knew this
      immutable, somber face under every shifting aspect of light and shadow; he
      had stared at the mantling greatcoat and the huge bearskin of this hero of
      his a hundred times. The very first day of his arrival in London he had
      made the acquaintance of this statue, and had started, dazed and
      fascinated, at the strange resemblance it suggested. Thus his boy-father
      must have looked, with the beard and the heavy dress of the Russian
      winter. The metal figure came to mean to him more than all London beside.
      In the sad, strong, silent countenance which gazed down upon him he read
      forever the tragedy that gripped his heartstrings. Forever Honor, standing
      aloft, held the laurel wreath poised high above the warrior&rsquo;s head&mdash;immovable
      in the air, never to descend to touch its mark. Christian had seen this
      wreath always through moist eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning, for a wonder, no tearful impulse came to him as he looked
      upward. The impassive face was as gravely fine as ever, but its customary
      effect of pathos was lacking. There even seemed in its sightless eyes a
      latent perception of Christian&rsquo;s altered mood. He lifted his hat soberly
      and saluted the statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the Strand now he made his way, walking blithely, and humming to
      himself. He could not forbear to smile at a policeman he passed in front
      of St. Martin&rsquo;s. Two elderly and much bewrapped cabmen stood stamping
      their feet beside a shelter, and they pointed toward their ridiculous old
      horses and battered growlers as he came along, with an air that moved him
      to glee. He gave them a shilling to divide, and went on, conscious of a
      novel delight in himself and in the world at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big clock showed it to be half-past five. There was no blue in the
      sky, but the mist of daybreak was abating, and the air was milder. Not a
      living creature was visible along the naked length of the Strand. At the
      end, the beautiful spire of St. Mary&rsquo;s rose from the dim grays about its
      base, exquisite in tints and contour as an Alpine summit in the moment
      before sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      A turning to the left opened to Christian, unexpectedly, a scene full of
      motion and color. He had not thought himself so near Covent Garden, but
      clearly this must be it. He walked up toward the busy scene of high-laden
      vans, big cart-horses and swarming porters, wondering why no sign of all
      this activity was manifest in the sleeping Strand below, barely a stone&rsquo;s
      throw distant. He saw the glowing banks of flowers within, as he
      approached, and made toward them, sighing already with pleasure at the
      promise they held out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have read in the papers that it was a backward and a grudging
      April, this year, in the matter of flowers. But to Christian, no memory of
      the exuberant South suggested any rivalry with this wonderful show of
      northern blossoms. Tulips and daffodils, amaryllis and azaleas,
      rhododendrons, carnations, roses&mdash;he seemed to have imagined to
      himself nothing like this before. He spent over an hour among them, in the
      end making numerous purchases. At each stall he gave an address&mdash;always
      the same&mdash;and exacted the pledge of delivery at eight o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he could in reason buy nothing more, and he went out to look about
      him. He found the place where the market-men take drinks at all hours, and
      food and coffee when nature&rsquo;s sternest demands can be positively no longer
      disregarded&mdash;but it did not invite his appetite. Some further time he
      spent in gazing wondering at the vast walls of vegetables and fruit being
      tirelessly built up and pulled down again, pondering meanwhile the
      question whether he should breakfast before eight o&rsquo;clock, or at some
      indefinitely later hour. He partially solved the problem at length by
      buying a small box of Algerian peaches, and eating them where he stood.
      Then some exceptionally fine bananas tempted him further, and he finished
      with a delicate little melon from Sicily.
    </p>
    <p>
      How it carried him back to the days of his youth&mdash;this early morning
      fragrance of the fresh fruit! It was as if he were at Cannes again&mdash;only
      buoyant now, and happy, and oh, so free! And in his pocket he could feel
      whenever he liked the soft, munificent crackle of over four thousand
      francs! The sapphire Mediterranean had surely never been so lovely to his
      gaze as was now the dingy Strand below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laggard hour came round at last. He descended to Arundel Street, and
      discovered the house he wanted, and found just within the entrance two or
      three of the flower-laden porters awaiting his arrival, For the rest, the
      building seemed profoundly unoccupied. He led the way up to the third
      floor, and had the plants set down beside the locked door which bore the
      sign &ldquo;Miss Bailey.&rdquo; Other similarly burdened porters made their appearance
      in turn, till the narrow hallway looked like a floral annex to the Garden
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited alone with his treasures for what seemed to him a very long
      time, then descended and stood at the street door till he was tired, then
      climbed the stairs again. The extraordinary quiet of the big building,
      filled with business offices as it was, puzzled him. He had no experience
      of early-morning London to warn him that English habits differed from
      those of the continent. It occurred to him that perhaps it was a holiday&mdash;conceivably
      one of those extraordinary interludes called Bank Holidays&mdash;and he
      essayed a perplexing computation in the calendar in the effort to settle
      this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally there began the sounds of steps, and the opening and closing of
      doors, below him. A tow-headed boy in buttons came up to his landing,
      stared in vacuous amazement at him and the flowers and passed on to the
      next floor. Noises of occupancy rose from the well of the staircase to
      bear him countenance, and suddenly a lift glided up past him in this well.
      He had not noticed the ropes or the iron caging before. He heard the
      slamming of the lift doors above, and the dark carriage followed on its
      smooth descent. Christian reproached himself for not having rung the bell
      and questioned the lift-man. He considered the feasibility of doing it
      now, but was deterred by the fear that the man would resent it. Then the
      lift came up again&mdash;and was stopping at his floor. There was a sharp
      note of girlish laughter on the instant of the halt, answered by a male
      guffaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight, erect, active young woman emerged from the lift, her face alive
      with mirth of some unknown character. Behind her, in the obscurity,
      Christian saw for an instant the vanishing countenance of the liftman,
      grinning widely. This hilarity, somehow, struck in him an unsympathetic
      chord.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman, still laughing, spread an uncomprehending glance over
      Christian and his flowers. She moved past him, key in hand, toward the
      door which he had been guarding, with a puzzled eye upon him meanwhile.
      With the key in the lock she turned and decided to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What might all this be&mdash;the Temple Flower Show or the Crystal
      Palace?&rdquo; she asked, with banter in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are for Miss Bailey,&rdquo; said Christian, quite humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be some mistake,&rdquo; said the girl decisively. &ldquo;Did she order them
      herself? Were you there at the time? Did you see her? Where do they come
      from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian advanced a little into the light. &ldquo;She has not ordered them,&rdquo; he
      said, in his calmest voice. &ldquo;I have not seen her for a long time. But I
      have brought them for her, and I think you may take it from me that they
      are hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she replied, lightly but with grace. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      understand. Things are forever being brought here that belong somewhere
      else. Men are so stupid in finding their way about! Well&mdash;I suppose
      we must get them inside. That is your idea, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke very rapidly, and with a kind of metallic snap in her tones.
      Christian answered her questions by a suave assenting gesture. &ldquo;Miss
      Bailey is not likely to turn up much before half-past nine,&rdquo; she went on,
      as if he had made the inquiry. &ldquo;She lives so far out, and just now we&rsquo;re
      not very busy. There&rsquo;s nothing doing in new plays at this time of the
      year, and the lady novelists are all getting their own typewriters. If
      you&rsquo;ll lend a hand, we&rsquo;ll carry the things in.&rdquo; Between them they bore in
      the various pots, and the big bouquets loosely wrapped in blue paper. The
      girl led the way through a large working-room to a smaller apartment,
      fitted as an office but containing also a sofa and a tall gas
      cooking-stove&mdash;and here on desk and center-table, chairs and
      windowsill, they placed the flowers. Christian watched her as she deftly
      removed their paper wrappings. She had a comely, small face of aspect at
      once alert and masterful. The skin was peculiarly fair, with a tinge of
      rose in the cheeks so delicately modulated that he found it in rivalry
      with the &ldquo;Mrs. Pauls&rdquo; she was unpacking. Her light hair was drawn plainly
      down over the temples in a fashion which he felt was distinguished, but
      said to himself he did not like. Her shrewd eyes took calm cognizance of
      him from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are very beautiful indeed,&rdquo; she remarked with judicial approval,
      upon the completion of her task. Then, as upon an afterthought, she moved
      rapidly about, peering under the branches of the growing plants, and
      separating the cut flowers lightly with her hands. &ldquo;There is no card
      anywhere, is there? I suppose you will want to leave a message? Here are
      pen and ink&mdash;if you wish to write anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Christian began, smilingly but with obvious hesitation. He
      looked at his watch. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;if you&rsquo;re quite sure I
      shan&rsquo;t be in the way&mdash;I think I should like to wait till Miss Bailey
      comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you won&rsquo;t be in the way,&rdquo; the girl replied. She regarded him
      meditatively, with narrowed eyes. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t dust this room in any event&mdash;since
      the flowers are here; but you mustn&rsquo;t come out into the big room&mdash;unless
      you want to get choked with blacks. Would you like a morning paper? I can
      send a boy out for one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;you are very good&mdash;no,&rdquo; Christian answered. &ldquo;There
      are some books here&mdash;I shall amuse myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned to leave him, and then on second thought moved over to the
      window and lifted the sash. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no objection to your smoking if
      you like,&rdquo; she informed him. Then she went out, closing the door behind
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian walked to the window in turn, and looked down over the flowers
      to the narrow street below. It was full of young men in silk hats, toiling
      up the granite ascent like black ants. He reflected that they must be
      clerks and shopmen, going to their daily work from the Temple station or
      the Embankment. The suggestion of monotonous bondage which their swarming
      progress toward the wage-earning center gave forth, interested him. He
      yawned pleasurably at the thought of his own superb emancipation from
      duties and tasks of all descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He strolled over to the bookcase above the desk, and glanced at the
      volumes revealed through its glass doors. They seemed very serious books,
      indeed. &ldquo;Economics of Socialism,&rdquo; &ldquo;Capitalist Production,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ethics of
      Socialism,&rdquo; &ldquo;Towards Democracy&rdquo;&mdash;so the titles ran that first met his
      eye. There were other groups&mdash;mainly of history and the essayists&mdash;but
      everything was substantial. His glance sought in vain any lightsome gleam
      of poetry or fiction. The legend on a thin red book, &ldquo;Civilization: Its
      Cause and Cure,&rdquo; whimsically caught his attention. He put his hand to the
      key in the bookcase door to get out the volume; then, hesitating, yawned,
      and looked over the shelves once more. There was nothing else&mdash;and
      really he desired to read nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would half recline in comfort upon the sofa instead, until his friend
      came. As a pleasing adjunct to this plan, he drew the table up close, and
      found room upon it, by crowding them together, for most of the flowers
      that had been bestowed elsewhere. He seated himself at his ease, with his
      head resting against the wall, and surveyed the plants and blossoms in
      affectionate admiration. It was delicious to think how naïve her surprise
      would be&mdash;how great her pleasure! Truly, since his discovery of his
      birthright, remarkable and varied as had been his experiences, he had done
      nothing else which afforded him a tithe of the satisfaction he felt now
      glowing in all his veins. Here, at last, by some curious and devious
      chance, he had stumbled upon the thing that was genuinely worth doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could hear the cheerful girl in the next room, whistling gently to
      herself as she moved the furniture about. There came presently the sound
      of other female voices, and then a sustained, vibrant rattle, quaintly
      accentuated like the ticking of a telegraph key, which he grew accustomed
      to, and even found pleasant to the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his feet up on the edge of the sofa&mdash;and nestled downward till
      his head was upon it as well. A delicate yet pervasive fragrance from the
      table close beside him aroused his languid curiosity. Was it the perfume
      of carnations or of roses?
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes the better to decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the outer room, Miss Connie Staples permitted herself numerous and
      varied speculations as to the identity and purposes of the young man with
      the flowers, the while she dusted the typewriters, distributed the copy
      for the morning&rsquo;s start and set the place in order. She had her sleeves
      rolled up, and had wound a big handkerchief about her hair; beneath this
      turban her forehead scored itself in lines of perplexed wonderment as to
      this curious early caller&mdash;but when two other girls arrived, she
      suffered them to put aside their things and begin work without so much as
      hinting at what had happened. A third girl, coming a little later, brought
      in a stray blossom which she had picked up in the corridor outside. She
      mentioned the fact, and even laid stress upon it, but got no syllable of
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all simple enough, but at half-past nine the arrival of still
      another of the sex put Miss Connie&rsquo;s resources to an unexpected test.
    </p>
    <p>
      A handsome, youngish woman, very well dressed indeed, appeared suddenly
      upon the threshold of the workroom, knocking upon the door and pushing it
      wide open at the same instant. She looked curiously about, and then
      point-blank into the face of the girl who came toward her. It was a glance
      of independent and impersonal criticism which the two exchanged, covering
      with instantaneous swiftness an infinitude of details as to dress,
      coiffure, complexion, figure, temperament and origin. Connie wondered if
      the new-comer was really quite a lady, long before she formulated an
      inquiring thought about her errand. Even as she finally looked this
      question of business, she decided that it was an actress with a play for
      the provinces, and asked herself if she did not seem to recognize the
      face. The visitor, for her part, saw that Connie&rsquo;s teeth were too uneven
      to be false, and that her waist was overlong, and that her hair was not
      thick enough to be worn flat over the temples, much less to justify so
      confident a manner. In all, something less than a second of time had
      elapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see Miss Bailey&mdash;Miss Frank Bailey,&rdquo; explained the
      stranger, graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connie conveyed to her, with courteous brevity, the fact that Miss Bailey
      had not yet arrived. &ldquo;Is it something that I can do?&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other shook her head, and showed an affable thread of white between
      her freshened lips. &ldquo;No, I will wait for her,&rdquo; she answered, and threw a
      keen glance about the place. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her private room, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she
      asked, nodding at the closed door to the right. &ldquo;I will wait in there,&rdquo;
       she decided, in the same breath, and began moving toward it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connie alertly headed her off. &ldquo;If you will kindly take a seat here&mdash;&rdquo;
       she interposed, standing in front of her visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too noisy out here,&rdquo; remarked the other; &ldquo;those horrid machines
      would give me a headache. That <i>is</i> her private room, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; Connie began, lowering her voice, &ldquo;the room belongs to
      another office. Or rather, I should say, it is locked. Miss Bailey will be
      here&mdash;with the key&mdash;very shortly now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right&mdash;I&rsquo;m her sister,&rdquo; explained the other, in no wise
      resenting the ineffectual fabrications. She pushed forward past the
      reluctant girl with a resolute step, and put her hand on the knob of the
      tabooed door. &ldquo;Make your mind quite easy, my dear,&rdquo; she remarked over her
      shoulder, sinking her voice in turn in deference to the situation; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
      done all that could be expected of you&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll tell her so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a momentary gleam of good nature on her pretty face, which the
      short transparent veil she wore to her chin seemed to accentuate rather
      than mask, she opened the door, threw up her head with a swift, puzzled
      glance at what she saw, and then tiptoed gracefully into the room, closing
      the door with painstaking noiselessness behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Frances Bailey entered her office not many minutes later, her cheeks
      aglow with the morning air as the wheelwoman meets it. She nodded
      cheerfully to Connie, and beyond her to the girls at the machines, as her
      hand sought for a hat-pin at the back of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any word from the Lyceum?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;And what does that Zambesi-travel
      manuscript make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie ignored industrial topics. &ldquo;There are people waiting in there to
      see you,&rdquo; she announced, in low, significant tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress was impressed by the suggestion of mystery. &ldquo;People? What
      people?&rdquo; she asked, knitting her brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them says she&rsquo;s your sister. And the other is a young gentleman&mdash;he
      came first&mdash;and he brought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister?&rdquo; interrupted Miss Bailey. &ldquo;Cora! Something dreadful must have
      happened&mdash;for she never got out so early as this before in her life.
      Is she in mourning? Did she seem upset?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Not</i> a bit of it!&rdquo; said Connie, reassuringly. She added, following
      the other toward the private office: &ldquo;I tried my best to keep her out
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you?&rdquo; asked Frances, with wide-open eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; replied the girl, evasively. &ldquo;I told you
      there was some one else in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances opened the door&mdash;and Connie noted that she too lifted her
      head and stared a little, and then cautiously closed the door behind her.
      She pondered this as she returned to her machine, and she curled her thin
      lip when she took up the copies of the first act of an amateur&rsquo;s romantic
      play, to underscore the business directions with red ink, and sew on brown
      paper covers. Intuition told her that a much better drama was afoot, here
      under her very nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside her office, Miss Bailey surrendered herself to frank astonishment
      at what she beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bestowed in obvious discomfort upon her sofa, behind an extraordinary bank
      of potted plants and bright, costly greenhouse flowers, was a young man
      fast asleep. Her eye took in as well her sister, who sat near the head of
      the sofa, but she could wait. The interest centered in this sleeping
      stranger, who made himself so much at home in the shelter of his
      remarkable floral barricade. She moved round the better to scrutinize his
      face, which was tilted up as if proudly held even in slumber. Upon
      examination she recognized the countenance; and in a swift moment of
      concentration tried to think what his presence might signify. Then she
      turned to her sister, and lifted her calm brows in mute inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear&mdash;what splendid business!&rdquo; whispered Cora, her glance
      beaming upward from the sofa to the standing figure. &ldquo;And mind, Frank, I&rsquo;m
      in it! I&rsquo;m in it up to my neck! I sent him to you, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked down at them both, and deliberated before she spoke. &ldquo;If
      you brought him here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better take him away
      again. I can let you out by this other door. Let us have no more publicity
      than necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t in the least understand!&rdquo; protested Cora, with her finger
      raised in an appeal for quiet tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t understand. I don&rsquo;t want to understand,&rdquo; replied Frances
      coldly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t understand either, Cora: This
      is my typewriting office; it isn&rsquo;t a greenroom at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it well might be,&rdquo; retorted the other, with a latent grin. &ldquo;Anything
      greener than its owner I never saw. Now listen&mdash;don&rsquo;t be a silly
      cuckoo! I met the youngster last night&mdash;and I worked him up till he
      was mad to learn where you were to be found. I told him&mdash;and then I
      went home, and I couldn&rsquo;t sleep for thinkin&rsquo; of you, dear&mdash;and so I
      turned out at some extraordinary hour this mornin&rsquo;&mdash;it is mornin&rsquo; by
      this time, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;and I came here, just to tell you that he was
      askin&rsquo; after you&mdash;and I come in here&mdash;and lo! here&rsquo;s the bird on
      his little nest!&mdash;and see the flowers he&rsquo;s brought from Covent Garden
      for you!&mdash;and so I sit here like Patience on a monument, afraid to
      wink an eyelash, so&rsquo;s not to wake him till you come. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done
      for <i>you</i>, dear&mdash;and presently, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d like to
      hear what you&rsquo;ll do for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances put a knee upon the chair before her, and rested with her hands
      upon its back. She sighed a little, and bit her lips. A troubled look came
      into her gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might as well say all you have to say,&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t in
      the least see what you&rsquo;re up to&mdash;but then I never did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear, you never did,&rdquo; responded Cora, smiling as if in pleased
      retrospect. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t be a good sister to you.
      If it&rsquo;s one&rsquo;s nature to be a good sister, why, then one will be&mdash;and
      there you are, don&rsquo;t you see? I take no credit to myself for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said the other. The two women spoke in hushed whispers, and with
      each sentence stole glances of precaution toward the sleeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Frank, I look to you not to forget what I&rsquo;ve done. I spent two or
      three very hard hours last night talkin&rsquo; him round, and singin&rsquo; your
      praises to him&mdash;and I put Covent Garden into his head, too&mdash;-and
      here he is! And I kept Eddy and Gus off his back, too&mdash;they were
      frightfully keen to get at him&mdash;but I said no, and I held &rsquo;em
      to heel. It was all for you, dear. They might have queered the whole
      pitch, if I&rsquo;d given &rsquo;em their heads. But now about myself. I&rsquo;m
      tired, dead tired, of bein&rsquo; poor. Of course we get a little something from
      Lord Julius. But Eddy&mdash;you know what Eddy is! No sooner does he pick
      himself up from Epsom than Ascot gives him a fair knockout, and if he
      lives through the Sandown Eclipse there&rsquo;s Goodwood waitin&rsquo; for him with a
      facer. I can&rsquo;t understand it; other men seem to win sometimes&mdash;you&rsquo;d
      think the unluckiest duffer would get a look-in once in a while&mdash;but
      no, he just gets hammered one meeting after another. And I&rsquo;m tired of it,
      Frank! If I could only go back to work! But if I get an engagement, then
      Eddy will go playin&rsquo; the goat&mdash;he&rsquo;s jealous of everybody about the
      place from the bandmaster down to the carpenter&rsquo;s boy&mdash;and that makes
      me unpopular&mdash;and there we are, don&rsquo;t you see! I&rsquo;m worn out with it.
      But if I could have eight hundred a year, or even six hundred or five at a
      pinch&mdash;God knows, my wants are simple enough!&mdash;and have it paid
      to me personally, do you see&mdash;why, then, life would be worth livin&rsquo;.
      Now, what do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances looked moodily down at her distinguished sister, her lips twisted
      in stormy amusement. &ldquo;Why not say a thousand and be done with it?&rdquo; she
      demanded between set teeth, after an ominous pause. &ldquo;One would be as
      intelligent as the other. And oughtn&rsquo;t I to set your Eddy up with a racing
      stud while I&rsquo;m about it? It&rsquo;s true that I have about twenty pounds a year
      for my own personal use, and Tom has a standing grievance that I don&rsquo;t
      give even <i>that</i> to him&mdash;but don&rsquo;t let that interfere with your
      plans. Whatever you feel that you would like, just give it a name.
      Couldn&rsquo;t I lease one of the new Kaffir mansions in Park Lane for you? Or
      would you prefer something in Grosvenor Square?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cora gazed up with such intentness at her unnatural sister that a bright
      little tear came to shine at the corner of each eye. She put up her veil
      then, and breathed a cautious sigh. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect this of you, dear,&rdquo;
       she said, submissively. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s the old story&mdash;La Cigale, and
      &lsquo;go-to-the ant-thou-sluggard&rsquo; and all that. I don&rsquo;t see myself why a
      typewriting machine should make one so fearfully stony-hearted; you get
      callouses on your fingers, I know, but you needn&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em on your
      sisterly affections, one would think. But however&rdquo;&mdash;she wiped her
      eyes, drew down her veil and allowed a truculent note to sound in her
      voice&mdash;&ldquo;however, if you won&rsquo;t play, why then neither will I. I&rsquo;ve
      been at pains to put this youngster in your way, but it won&rsquo;t be much
      trouble to shunt him out again. You mustn&rsquo;t think you can walk on me
      indefinitely, Frank. I&rsquo;m the best-natured woman in the world, but even I
      draw the line somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw it now then,&rdquo; said the other, with stern promptitude. &ldquo;Go away, and
      take your friend with you and let me get to my work. I don&rsquo;t know what
      business either of you had coming here, at all.&rdquo; As she spoke, she moved
      to the outer private door, and turned the key in the lock. &ldquo;You can send
      for the flowers,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;or I will have them taken over to Charing
      Cross Hospital&mdash;whichever you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cora rose, her veiled face luminous with a sudden inspiration. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
      quarrel with me, dear, no matter how hard you try.&rdquo; She spoke in low,
      cooing tones&mdash;a triumph of sympathetic voice production. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hard
      as nails, but I know you&rsquo;re straight. I will trust my interests absolutely
      in your hands. I leave it to you to do the fair thing by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fair thing?&rdquo; echoed Frances, in dubious perplexity. She puzzled over
      the words and their elusive implication. &ldquo;Your interests?&rdquo; she repeated&mdash;and
      saw Cora move round her to the unlocked door, and open it&mdash;and still
      sought to comprehend what it was all about. Only when her sister, smiling
      cordially once more, bent forward without warning and pressed her veiled
      lips against her chin, and with a gentle &ldquo;Goodbye, dear!&rdquo; stepped into the
      shadows without, did she recall the other features of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; she called, with nervous eagerness, yet keeping her voice down,
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not to run off like this. Take your man with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Softly, dear!&rdquo; Cora enjoined her, from the dusk of the hallway. &ldquo;Your
      young women wouldn&rsquo;t understand. No&mdash;I caught him for you, and I
      leave him in your hands. I&rsquo;m not in the least afraid to trust it all to
      you. Bye-bye, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances went out and glared down the staircase, with angry expostulation
      on her tongue&rsquo;s end. But there was nobody to talk to. She could hear only
      the brisk rustle of Cora&rsquo;s skirts on the stone steps, a floor below&mdash;and
      even that died away beneath the clatter of the machines inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning over the threshold, she paused, and looked impatiently at the
      flowers, and at the impassive, slumbering face beyond them. After a
      little, the lines of vexation began to melt from her brow. In a musing
      way, she put a hand behind her, and as if unconsciously closed and locked
      the hall door again. Then she moved to the table, picked up some of the
      loose blossoms and breathed in their fragrance, still keeping her
      thoughtful gaze upon the young man. She found the face much older and
      stronger than she remembered it&mdash;and in a spirit of fairness she said
      to herself that it seemed no whit less innocent. But then perhaps all
      sleeping faces looked innocent; she could recall that Cora&rsquo;s certainly
      did. Holding the carnations to her lips and nostrils, she examined in
      meditative detail the countenance before her&mdash;delicately modeled,
      dark, nervously high-spirited even in repose. Associations came back as
      she gazed&mdash;the tender eagerness of the lad, the wistful charm with
      which his fancy had invested England, the frank sweetness of the
      temperament he had disclosed to her. He had been like a flower himself on
      that mellow autumn day&mdash;as fresh and as goodly to the eye as these
      roses on the table. But a winter had intervened since then&mdash;and what
      gross disillusionments, what roughening and hardening and corroding
      experiences had he not encountered! You could not tell anything by a face
      in sleep; again she assured herself of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, when one came to think of it, it was enough that Cora had brought him&mdash;or
      sent him, it mattered not which. Whence had she dispatched him?&mdash;from
      some theatrical dance or late supper. It was true that he was not in
      evening dress&mdash;and the thought gave her pause for a moment. But he
      had been at some place where those wretched cousins of his were present&mdash;for
      Cora had spoken of keeping both Eddy and Gus &ldquo;off his back&rdquo;&mdash;whatever
      that might mean. And it was Cora herself who had told him to go to Covent
      Garden and buy these flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances, revolving these unpleasant reflections, discovered all at once
      that the young man, without betraying by any other motion his awakening,
      had opened his eyes and was looking placidly across the flowers into her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught a quick breath, and frowned slightly at him.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> don&rsquo;t think I
      like your being here,&rdquo; Frances remarked to the young man after a brief
      frowning inspection. She spoke slowly, and with a deliberate gravity and
      evenness of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian&rsquo;s wide-open eyes continued to gaze up at her with that
      disconcerting look which had in it both remote abstraction and something
      very intimately personal. His glance expressed a tender pleasure as it
      maintained itself against hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I like it so very much!&rdquo; he murmured, with a pleading smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, by a sudden movement, he sat up, flushing in a novel embarrassment.
      &ldquo;I beg you to pardon me,&rdquo; he urged, faltering over his words. &ldquo;I was not
      wholly awake, I think; or I was trying to persuade myself that it was
      still a dream. Do not think me so rude, I pray you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She signified by a gesture and momentary facial relaxation that this
      particular detail of the situation need not detain them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;she began, in her stiffest and least amiable voice, and then
      hesitated. She put her knee again upon the chair, and, resting her hand on
      its back, looked dubiously at him. &ldquo;I hardly know what to say,&rdquo; she
      started once more, and stopped altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it is I who must say everything,&rdquo; he broke in, eagerly. &ldquo;I am
      quite awake now&mdash;I see, of course, it is all absurd, meaningless in
      your eyes, till I explain it to you.&rdquo; He rose to his feet and put forth
      his hand as if to offer it in greeting. No responsive token being visible
      on her set face, or in her rigid posture, as she confronted him, he waved
      both hands in a deprecatory movement over the table laden with flowers
      between them. &ldquo;These are my peace-offering,&rdquo; he said, with less
      confidence. &ldquo;I hoped they would say some things for me&mdash;some things
      which I feel within me, and cannot easily put into speech. That is what I
      expected they would surely do. But&rdquo;&mdash;he finished with dejection,
      after another glance into her face&mdash;&ldquo;evidently they are as
      tongue-tied as I am. I see it was not a happy thought in me to bring them&mdash;or
      to come myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had followed his words with rapt attentiveness&mdash;but at the end
      seemed to remember only one of them. &ldquo;The &lsquo;thought,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said, coldly.
      &ldquo;Yes, that is what I do not understand. What was the thought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He regarded her with some perplexity. &ldquo;What was the thought&mdash;my
      thought?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;since it does not explain itself, what
      good is there in talking about it? Let us say that there was no &lsquo;thought&rsquo;
      at all. I will make my compliments and apologies&mdash;and say
      good-morning&mdash;and nothing at all will have happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered reflectively. &ldquo;That would be stupid. You have been to
      expense, and evidently to some inconvenience as well, to do this thing. On
      second thoughts,&rdquo; she went on, with an apparent effort to modify the
      asperities of her tone and manner, &ldquo;I dare say that I haven&rsquo;t behaved
      quite nicely to you. If you remember, I told you a long time ago that bad
      manners was a failing of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember every little word that you spoke,&rdquo; said Christian softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances hardened her voice on the instant. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t help me to
      understand why&mdash;what this is all about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He responded slowly, searching for his words as he went along. The rattle
      of machines in the next room for the first time came into the
      conversation, and forced him to lift his voice. &ldquo;You were my last friend
      in France&mdash;my first friend in England,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I said I would not
      forget you, and you have been always in my mind&mdash;always somewhere
      secure and fresh and sweet in my mind. It was only last night that I
      learned where I might find you. You will remember that when I begged you
      to tell me, you laughed and would not. I must not make you believe that I
      did not very soon find out your name or that I could not have learned your
      whereabouts much earlier. All I say is that I did not forget&mdash;and
      that last night, when the chance came naturally to me, I asked and learned
      what I desired to know. And then&mdash;why, then&mdash;this knowledge
      spread upward to be of more importance than all the other things I knew. I
      went home&mdash;but never to think of sleeping, but only to change my
      clothes and hasten out again, to get some new morning flowers for you,
      and to come to you at the earliest moment. I did not know that London rose
      so late&mdash;I arrived before the time, and, so it seems, waiting for
      your coming, I fell asleep. That is the entire story. You see it is not
      very complicated&mdash;it is by no means extraordinary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances had listened with a dreamy gentleness in her gray eyes. She
      started slightly when he stopped, and gave him a keen, cool glance. &ldquo;The
      entire story?&rdquo; she queried. &ldquo;I think you have forgotten to mention that it
      was my sister who told you about me, and gave you my address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her prescience in no wise astonished Christian. Imagination had thrown
      round the Minerva-like figure which personified her in his thoughts, such
      a glamour of intellectual radiancy, that it seemed quite a natural thing
      for her to divine the obscure, and comprehend the mysterious. He smiled at
      her as he shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;It did not occur to me as important,&rdquo;
       he exclaimed. &ldquo;It is true, however, that she told me. She did not know the
      address when I asked her, but later she procured it for me from her
      brother. It was at a supper at the Hanover Theater. Afterward there was
      dancing on the stage. I fear it would have been rather tiresome for me if
      I had not met your sister. She is a very friendly lady, and she talked a
      great deal to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About me?&rdquo; demanded Frances, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;about you only a few pleasant words; not more. It seems you
      do not meet very often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with such evident frankness that she hesitated over the further
      inquiry her mind had framed. At last she put it in altered form. &ldquo;Then you
      would not say that she sent you here&mdash;-that she told you to come&mdash;and
      to come by way of Covent Garden, and buy these flowers?&rdquo; The question, as
      she uttered it, was full of significant suggestion about the nature of the
      reply desired. Its tone, too, carried the welcome hint of a softened mood,
      under the influence of which Christian&rsquo;s face brightened with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, not at all!&rdquo; he cried, lifting his voice gaily above the
      typewriters&rsquo; clatter. &ldquo;She did speak of Covent Garden, and the show of
      flowers there in the early morning, but it was not in the least with
      reference to you. It was my own idea long after she had gone. Oh, no one
      would be more surprised than that good sister of yours to know that I am
      here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances, with a puzzling smile which ended in a long breath of relief,
      took up some of the roses and held them to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down again,&rdquo; she bade him, with a pleasant glow in the eyes regarding
      him over the blossoms; &ldquo;sit down, and let us talk. Or does that noise bore
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am too glad!&rdquo; he assured her, beamingly. &ldquo;If it were cannon firing
      in the next room, it would be nothing to me.&rdquo; Then, as he continued to
      gaze with delight at her, an inspiration came to him. &ldquo;Or is it possible
      for you to come out? Would you walk a little while, perhaps on the
      Embankment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not particularly busy this morning,&rdquo; she made indirect answer. Then
      a digression occurred to her. &ldquo;But I am rather surprised,&rdquo; she observed,
      &ldquo;to find that England hasn&rsquo;t made more changes in your speech. I would
      have expected a perfect Piccadilly accent, but you talk exactly as you did
      on the train and the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed and clapped his hands for glee. &ldquo;It is wholly because I am with
      you again,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Everybody has said for months that the foreign
      traces had quite vanished from my tongue&mdash;but the first glimpse of
      you&mdash;ah! they come instantly back! It is the association of ideas,
      beyond doubt&mdash;that very sweet association,&rdquo; he added, with trembling
      softness, &ldquo;of oh! such fond ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had taken up her hat. &ldquo;We will go out for a little, if you like,&rdquo; she
      remarked rather abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am altogether forgiven?&rdquo; he demanded in high spirits, as he rose.
      &ldquo;You consent to accept the flowers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven only knows what I shall do with them,&rdquo; she answered, with a
      grimace of mock despair. &ldquo;But it was ever so nice of you to get them, and
      I thank you very much. Oh, I must tell Connie to sprinkle them before I
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved to the inner door, and as she opened it turned. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you
      like to come and see the factory at work?&rdquo; she inquired, and he joined her
      with alacrity. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much to see at the moment,&rdquo; she explained, as
      they entered the large room. &ldquo;We have nine machines, but only four of them
      are needed just now. Until after the Jubilee, I&rsquo;m afraid things will be
      very dull with publishers and playwrights. However, one must take the lean
      with the fat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian looked somewhat nervously about him, while his friend stepped
      aside to confer with the girl whom he remembered from the early morning.
      Both this young lady and the three at their machines made a rapid, and as
      it seemed to him, perfunctory survey of their mistress&rsquo;s guest, and bent
      their attention upon their duties again as if his presence signified
      nothing whatever to them. He suspected that in reality they were plunged
      in furious speculation concerning him; and this embarrassed him so much
      that he turned and strolled back toward the open door and even entered the
      office before Frances rejoined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came back to him, she took from the table a couple of pale,
      half-opened tea-rose buds, gave one to him to fix in his lapel and pinned
      the other to the breast of her fawn-gray frock. &ldquo;If you are ready,&rdquo; she
      said, smilingly, and led the way to the staircase. As she descended before
      him, he noted the intelligent simplicity of this dress she wore&mdash;how
      it fitted her as gracefully and as artistically as Poole ever fitted Dicky
      Westland. About her hat, the carriage of her head and shoulders, the free
      decision of her step, there was something individual which appealed
      directly to him&mdash;a charm which would not be duplicated by any other
      person in the world. He looked at his watch as he went down, and found
      with surprise that it was nearly eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped to her side at the street doorway, with a meaning gesture. &ldquo;Do
      you remember,&rdquo; he said, gently&mdash;&ldquo;on the boat you took my arm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think London is a little different,&rdquo; she answered, decisively enough,
      yet with the effect to his ears of unreserved camaraderie.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked slowly down to the end of the street. &ldquo;Do you mind which way
      we go?&rdquo; she asked him, and turned eastward. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen the city in an
      age,&rdquo; she remarked, as if the choice needed explanation. Sauntering along,
      they found little to say to each other at the outset. What words they
      exchanged were about the mild, sunless sky of the London April, and the
      wonderful pencilings and rubbings of soot upon the silver-gray of London&rsquo;s
      stone walls. Learning that he was a stranger to the Temple, she led the
      way through the gate and lane, and then, by turnings which it surprised
      him to find her knowing so well, to the curious little church. The door in
      the sunken porch was ajar, and they went in. She pointed to the circle of
      freestone Crusaders looking complacently up from the floor at the Oriental
      dome which had caught their traveled fancy ages before, and it occurred to
      her to say: &ldquo;Is it not interesting to you to think that there were Torrs
      who were friends and companions of these very Magnavilles and Mareschalls,
      six hundred years ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thrust out his lips a little. &ldquo;I have not much interest in anything
      concerning the Torrs,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him with curiosity, but offered no comment. They left the
      church, and she led him round to the spot where, amid the cracked old
      flags from forgotten graves, Oliver Goldsmith&rsquo;s tomb now finds itself. A
      crumbling wreath of natural flowers showed that some kindly soul had
      remembered the date of the poet&rsquo;s death, three weeks before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian displayed scarcely more interest here. &ldquo;I have not read his
      &lsquo;Vicar of Wakefield,&rsquo;&rdquo; he confessed to her. &ldquo;I had always the intention to
      do so, but it&mdash;it never came off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That brings me to one thing I wanted to ask you,&rdquo; she said, as they
      retraced their steps. &ldquo;What books have you been reading&mdash;since you
      came to England? I am anxious to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not many,&rdquo; he admitted with an attempted laugh which ended rather
      shamefacedly. &ldquo;Reading did not fit itself very readily into my time. At
      Lord Chobham&rsquo;s I read in some old books, and at Emanuel&rsquo;s too, but it was
      all about our own people&mdash;the Barons&rsquo; War, and the Wars of the Roses,
      and the Civil War. I know something about these and about the old families
      of the West, but not much else. I should have read more, I know, but there
      was really not much opportunity. But you&mdash;I saw at your office what
      serious books you read. It is what I should like to do, too&mdash;sometimes.
      But there has been no one to talk with about any kind of books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had come out again to the Embankment, and made their pace now even
      more deliberate. &ldquo;I have been thinking a great deal about you, and your
      future, since we met,&rdquo; she remarked, after a pause. &ldquo;It has made me wonder
      what you would do, when the opportunity came to you&mdash;and what it
      would be open for you to do. That is why I began reading the books that I
      take it you have in mind&mdash;but afterward I read them for their own
      value. At the beginning&rdquo;&mdash;she went on slowly, studying the sky-line
      in an abstracted way as she walked&mdash;&ldquo;at the beginning I thought I
      should see you again sometime, and I had the idea that I wanted to be able
      to advise&mdash;or no, not that, but to talk to you, and try to interest
      you in the right sort of things. But it did not take me long to see how
      foolish that was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; urged Christian; without, however, any convincing display of
      enthusiasm. &ldquo;There is no one in the world from whom I will so gladly take
      advice as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled fleetingly at him. &ldquo;And there is no one in the world,&rdquo; she
      replied, &ldquo;more firmly resolved not to offer you any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but if I beg it! You may not offer&mdash;but will you refuse to
      give?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the good?&rdquo; she broke forth in a louder tone, speaking as if in
      annoyed reproof to herself. &ldquo;No person can think or feel or decide for
      another! It is nonsense to pretend otherwise. A man must think his own
      thoughts, follow his own nature! We can ask nothing finer of a man than to
      honestly be himself. I get so angry at all these ceaseless attempts to run
      people all into one mold, to make everybody like everybody else&mdash;and
      then, here I was, solemnly starting out to do the very trick myself!&rdquo; She
      laughed in ironical self-depreciation at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian drew closer to her side. &ldquo;I have very many things to say to
      you,&rdquo; he began gravely. &ldquo;But I am in one way sorry that we went into the
      churchyard, because it has made us melancholy, and I was going to tell it
      all to you in the highest good spirits. We were both laughing like merry
      children when we left your place&mdash;and now we are sad. I like
      Emanuel&rsquo;s idea&mdash;he will have no tombs to be seen upon his estate.
      Death will come there as elsewhere, without doubt, but he will not be
      allowed to remain hanging about, thrusting his ugly presence upon happy
      people each time they walk in the street. At Emanuel&rsquo;s there is cremation&mdash;and
      that is the end of it. That is the portion of his System which pleases me
      most. It is the best thing in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked into his face. &ldquo;Then you are not wildly in love with his whole
      System?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? I grieve to say not. It is no doubt very admirable indeed&mdash;but&mdash;how
      shall I say?&mdash;it does not appeal to me. You are displeased with me
      for confessing it&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Displeased?&rdquo; she interrupted him, with a meaning laugh. &ldquo;Nothing could
      displease me less!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you do not love the System?&rdquo; he cried, with dancing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate it!&rdquo; she answered, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; He halted, to shake her by the hand with gay effusion. &ldquo;Let us
      abuse it together! You shall say it all, however, because I only dislike
      it, and cannot give any reasons why&mdash;but you will know them every
      one. Oh, this is splendid! I had the right instinct when I came to you! I
      have a great deal to tell you&mdash;but first you must tell me: what do
      you say about my cousin&rsquo;s System? I am burning to hear that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to evade the contagion of his sparkling face. She
      laughed in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it would be too long a story,&rdquo; she half protested. &ldquo;But to put it
      briefly, this is my idea. Emanuel seems to me to be a magnificent
      character, with one extraordinary limitation. I think it must be a Jewish
      limitation&mdash;for I have seen it pointed out that they do not invent
      things. That is Emanuel&rsquo;s flaw; he has not an original thought in his
      head. He merely carries to a mathematical point of expansion and
      development the ready-made ideas which he finds accepted all about him.
      What you see in him is a triumph of the Semitic passion for working a
      problem out to its ultimate conclusion. When you consider it, what has he
      done? Merely discovered, by tremendous labor and energy, the smoothest
      possible working arrangement of the social system which his class regards
      as best for itself, and hence for all mankind&mdash;the system which
      exalts a chosen few, and keeps all the rest in subjection. My dear sir,
      things do not rise higher than their source! How did the Torrs come by
      their estates? By stealing the birthright of thousands of dumb human
      beasts of burden, and riveting the family collar round their necks with no
      more regard for their wishes or their rights than as if they had been so
      many puppies or colts. And what was the origin of the Ascarel fortune? The
      most frightful and bloodstained human slavery in the poisonous jungles of
      the Dutch East Indies&mdash;that, and an ancient family business of
      international usury, every dirty penny in which if you followed it far
      enough, meant the flaying alive of a peasant, or the starvation of his
      little children. These are the things which your cousin inherits. He is
      fine enough to be ashamed of them, but he is not broad enough to repudiate
      them. He makes himself believe that they were wrong only in degree. He
      will admit that the Torrs were too brutal toward their serfs, the Ascarels
      too selfish with their millions. That is all. And he sets himself to
      proving that with the right kind of chief at their head these systems of
      theirs can be made not only respectable, but even profitable to the slaves
      as well as the master. He does not see that the systems themselves are
      crimes! &rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am glad that I came to you,&rdquo; said Christian, in low, earnest
      tones, in the pause which followed. The girl, breathing deeply under the
      fervor of her mood, looked fixedly before her toward the copper-haze above
      Paul&rsquo;s dome. He watched the noble immobility of her profile and thrilled
      at its suggestion of strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do him justice,&rdquo; she went on, musingly, &ldquo;he does not pretend that it
      is progress. He is honest, and he describes it as reaction&mdash;a long
      step backward. It is just that kind of honesty and devotion, plus
      wrong-headedness, which keeps us all at sixes and sevens. If we agree that
      there is no better-intentioned man alive than Emanuel&mdash;still he would
      do more harm than the most atrocious blackguard, if he had his way with
      the world. But fortunately, he will not have it. A vastly greater and
      loftier Jew has said that you cannot pour new wine into old bottles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked on for a little in silence. &ldquo;Have you been to Emanuel&rsquo;s place
      then?&rdquo; Christian asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I know it only from hearsay, and from his books. A woman novelist for
      whom I do work has been there, and she has told me a good deal about it.
      She is going to use it in a book, and would you believe it? she is crazy
      with enthusiasm about the whole thing. I tried to point out to her what
      she was doing, but you might as well talk to the east wind. The way women
      run after the hand that smites them, and beslaver it with kisses&mdash;that
      is the thing that enrages me most of all. Why, the very corner-stone of
      Emanuel&rsquo;s System is the perpetual enslavement of women. I am always
      surprised, when I hear about his mediæval arrangements, that he hasn&rsquo;t set
      up a ducking-stool for his women-folk. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a pure oversight on
      his part. Well, what are you to expect when cultivated women like Mrs.
      Sessyl-Trant turn up as frantic admirers of that sort of thing? However,
      thank goodness, women are not forever to be sold out by the fools of their
      own sex. It is impossible not to see that the tide has turned at last.
      There <i>is</i> a change&mdash;and I think something genuine and lasting
      is going to come out of it. I really think it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is what I feel,&rdquo; put in Christian, with confused eagerness. &ldquo;I
      have no clear thoughts about it, but it is my deep feeling that&mdash;that&mdash;what
      shall I say?&mdash;we are most at fault in the matter of the women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances pursued her thought, in frowning meditation. &ldquo;It is the new
      professional class, who earn their own living, who will help us out. These
      women, who have come through the mill of self-responsibility, will not
      accept the old nonsense invented for them, and imposed upon them by the
      women parasites. The younger women who take care of themselves have all
      begun to ask questions: &lsquo;Why should I do this?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I do that?&rsquo;
      &lsquo;And whose business but my own is it if I do the other?&rsquo; Unfortunately,
      they are too ready to accept the first answer that comes to them. Oh, that
      is the woeful trouble! Men have slowly built up for themselves a good deal
      of machinery by which they can find out what is true. I don&rsquo;t say they are
      not continually deceived, or that they invariably recognize the truth when
      they see it, but still they have certain facilities for protecting
      themselves against falsehoods. But women have practically none at all.
      They are systematically lied to from their cradle to their grave. They
      read so hard!&mdash;they are <i>the</i> consumers of novels, religious
      books, weekly newspapers, magazines, and the rest of it&mdash;but never a
      word of actual truth is allowed to reach them out of it all. Wherever they
      turn to inquire about themselves, about their rights and their duties in
      this world that they have been born into, they encounter this vast,
      unbroken conspiracy of liars. That is the gravest of all the disadvantages
      they labor under. Why, take even the &lsquo;New Woman&rsquo; fiction of a few years
      ago. There was a great hullabaloo raised over certain novels; at last,
      they cried, the truth was being-revealed by women, for women, of women.
      But what nonsense! It turned out not to be the truth at all, but only the
      old falsehood, disguised in hysterics and some shocking bad manners. There
      seems no escape for women anywhere. They are lied to by their parents,
      their parsons, their doctors, their authors&mdash;and of course they lie
      to one another. They have a whole debased currency of insincerities and
      flattering falsehoods which they pass among themselves, keeping straight
      faces all the while as if it were honest money.&mdash;But as I said, I
      think a change is coming. However, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk any more about it. I
      get too angry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you to be angry&mdash;only not with me,&rdquo; commented Christian with
      a sprightly smile. Then he added, more gravely, &ldquo;Oh, I can see how the
      women who work will make a change. It was very curious to me to see those
      girls at the machines in your office. It was one of them who let me in,
      before you came. She was quite different from any of the English women I
      have been meeting. One saw that she had thoughts of her own&mdash;an
      atmosphere of her own. I should not like to tell lies to her; I think she
      would detect them more rapidly than I could get them out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Connie,&rdquo; laughed Frances. &ldquo;Yes, she has a head on her shoulders. They
      are all fairly bright girls, and they get on together extremely well. It&rsquo;s
      quite their own idea to divide up the work equally among the lot, and when
      there is not much doing to take turns in working alternate days. I think
      it was rather fine of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is the class of women one would like to help,&rdquo; he declared.
      &ldquo;That is what I will devote myself to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is the class which prefers to help itself,&rdquo; she explained quietly.
      &ldquo;I see no way in which you could &lsquo;help&rsquo; them, as you call it. They don&rsquo;t
      want any help. Men in their position might take tips, but these girls
      won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; As he received the rebuff in silence, she changed the subject. &ldquo;I
      am meeting now some other young women who would interest you. They are
      doing newspaper work&mdash;and doing it on its merits, too, and not by the
      favoritism of editors and proprietors&mdash;and one or two evenings a week
      we all get together at my office and talk things over. Sometimes there are
      as many as twenty of us, including my girls. In a year or two, perhaps it
      will run to a club-room of our own. I don&rsquo;t know that I told you&mdash;I
      am getting into newspaper work myself. If I saw how to combine it with my
      office business, I could have a place on a regular daily staff. I&rsquo;m
      puzzling a good deal to find some way of making the two things go
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I envy you!&rdquo; broke in Christian, impulsively. &ldquo;You have work to do!
      You are interested in your work! You find in it not only occupation, but
      the opportunities of being useful to others, and of making your life, and
      other people&rsquo;s lives, worth living. But think of me! I have nothing in the
      wide world to do, except wait for a very strong old man to die. And when
      he dies, then still I have nothing to do worth doing. Don&rsquo;t you see that
      it is the most miserable of existences? I am filled with disgust for it. I
      cannot bear it another day. And that is what I was going to tell you. I
      have decided to leave it all&mdash;and go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frances paused for a moment to scrutinize, with slightly narrowed eyes,
      the excited face he turned to her. &ldquo;How will going away improve matters?&rdquo;
       she asked him, upon reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put out his lips, and shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;At least I shall be a
      free man,&rdquo; he affirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unconsciously she imitated his gesture in turn: &ldquo;It does not follow that a
      deserter is necessarily a free man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed and winced visibly under the words, and turned away biting his
      lips. Then, the vexation clearing from his face, he wheeled again, and
      regarded her with calm gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one else who could say that to me and not injure me,&rdquo; he
      answered, simply. &ldquo;But that is the characteristic of you&mdash;when you
      say such a thing to me, then it becomes a thing that should have been
      said. Yet perhaps it is not the final word, after all. Ask yourself what
      it is that I am deserting! Consider whether I should give up or gain
      something. Here in England it is possible for me to be one of two things&mdash;the
      conventional person of position like all the others, or the exceptional
      kind of being which Emanuel desires to make of me. I have been at school
      for half a year learning what it is that society in general expects a man
      in my situation to do. Now that I have learned it, frankly it makes me
      sick at heart. But then I have been at another school for a month,
      observing and studying what it is that Emanuel wishes me to undertake. We
      have agreed that that is not to be thought of, either. Then what am I to
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how does running away solve the difficulty?&rdquo; She put the question to
      him with gentle persistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but, you see,&rdquo; he rejoined, argumentatively, &ldquo;it is not alone a moral
      difficulty. There are practical questions, too. When I announce to Emanuel
      that I reject his plans for my future, then I am left to myself to be that
      most ridiculous of objects&mdash;a man with a great station and no money
      to keep it up. That is what I must be here in England. But in other
      countries, that will not be the case. There will always be enough money
      for me to live like a prince upon&mdash;so long as I travel about, in my
      own yacht if I like, or reside simply and happily in the beautiful places
      of the earth, here and there, as the fancy possesses me. Thus I can put to
      use the prestige of my title, when it is of advantage to do so&mdash;but
      only in so far as it is needful at the moment&mdash;and at the same time
      it does not become a burden to me in any degree. Now think carefully of
      this&mdash;is it not the wisest course for me?&rdquo; She seemed not to pause
      for thought at all. &ldquo;Oh, that depends upon how you define wisdom,&rdquo; she
      replied, promptly. &ldquo;There is the wisdom of the serpent, but fortunately
      there are many other kinds. No, I must say, you haven&rsquo;t convinced me in
      the least. However, you mustn&rsquo;t think that is of importance. You are under
      no obligation to convince me, surely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but that is everything to me,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;There are reasons&mdash;which
      I wish to explain to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not keep a new meaning out of the glance with which he enforced
      this assurance. They had strolled round to Ludgate Circus, and come to a
      halt on the corner, with their backs turned upon a window full of droll
      phrenological charts and symbols. He consulted his watch once more. &ldquo;I
      breakfasted so lightly, and so early,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;it is not luncheon
      time quite, but that will give us a table to ourselves. You will come
      across with me, will you not? There are truly important things which have
      not been said&mdash;which I much wish to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s reflection she nodded her assent.

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>hristian and
      Frances ate their luncheon in an upper chamber, close to a kind of balcony
      window, which gave upon one of the city&rsquo;s most crowded thoroughfares. An
      unceasing and uniform uproar&mdash;overridden from time to time by the
      superior tumult of a passing railway train on a bridge near by&mdash;rose
      from this indefatigable street. They had the room to themselves; the
      portentous din magnified the effect of the solitude in which they regarded
      each other, crumbling the bread on the table absent-mindedly, and waiting
      for the inspiration of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I get back,&rdquo; the girl said at last with a smile, &ldquo;the racket of my
      typewriters will seem like the murmur of a gentle breeze down a leafy
      country lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed&mdash;but they had discovered it was not so hard to make
      oneself heard as they had supposed. Their voices intuitively found a level
      which served their personal needs, yet did not incommode the waiters
      yawning at the head of the stairway outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you taken to the bicycle?&rdquo; she was moved in sheer irrelevance to ask
      him. When he shook his head, she went on: &ldquo;It is a wonderful thing for
      women. It has done more for them in three years, than all the progressive
      intellectual movements of civilization did in three hundred. We all use
      them, coming to and from the office. We have to store them down in the
      area, now&mdash;but I am going to find a better place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian rolled his bread crumbs into balls and stared at them in a brown
      study, from which this topic was powerless to arouse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he said, finally&mdash;&ldquo;I wish very much that I knew how to
      convince you. But I seem never to produce any impression upon you. You are
      unyielding to the touch. It is I who get molded and kneaded about whenever
      I come close to you. And I don&rsquo;t say that it is not for the best. Only&mdash;only
      now, you will not accept my own ideas of what I should do, and you will
      not tell me what your ideas are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that I have any ideas,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;It is merely
      that, on general principles, I don&rsquo;t care for the people who settle
      difficulties by turning tail and running away from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he began, as if an important premise had been accepted. &ldquo;But
      as to my special case, I have stated what must be my position if I remain
      in England. To me it seems that it must be impossible&mdash;intolerable.
      But you have some different view, evidently. That is what I beg you to
      explain to me. If I am to remain in England, what is it your idea that I
      should do?&rdquo; She knitted her brows a little, and took time to her reply.
      &ldquo;You seem to think so entirely of yourself,&rdquo; she said, slowly, &ldquo;it is very
      hard to know what to say to you. I cannot put myself, you see, so
      completely in your place, as you are always able to do.&rdquo; He opened his
      eyes wide, and informed their gaze with a surprised reproach. &ldquo;There you
      are surely unjust to me,&rdquo; he urged, pleadingly. &ldquo;I do not know anyone who
      thinks more about other people than I do. One hesitates to say these
      things about oneself&mdash;but truly you are mistaken in this matter. In
      fact, I wonder sometimes if it is not a fault, a weakness in my nature,
      that I am so readily moved by the sufferings and wrongs of unhappy people.
      Whenever I see injustice, I am beside myself with a passion to set it
      right. I grow almost sick with indignation, and pity, when these things
      come before me. Last night, for example, at the Empire&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian stopped abruptly, with the sudden consciousness that the ground
      was not clear before him. He saw that he was entirely without a clue as to
      what his companion&rsquo;s views on the subject might be. That was her
      peculiarity: he knew concerning her thoughts and inclinations only what
      she chose to reveal to him. It was beyond his power to predict what her
      attitude would be on any new topic. Looking at her thoughtful, serene-eyed
      face, it decidedly seemed to him that the Empire, as an ethical problem,
      might with advantage be passed by. He hesitated for a moment, in the
      friendly shelter of the street noise, and then gave another termination to
      his speech: &ldquo;It puzzles me that you should have that view of my
      temperament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is just it&mdash;you have put the word into my mouth. It is
      &lsquo;temperament&rsquo; that you are thinking of&mdash;and about that you are
      perfectly right. Your temperament is as open to the impulses of the moment&mdash;kindly,
      generous, compassionate and all that&mdash;as a flower is to the bees. But
      character is another matter. What good do your fine momentary sentiments,
      these rapid noble emotions of yours, do you or anybody else? You
      experience them&mdash;and forget them. The only thing that abides
      permanently with you is consideration for your own personal affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all very unjust,&rdquo; he said, disconsolately. &ldquo;I come to you for
      solace and friendship, and you turn upon me with beak and claws.&rdquo; He
      sighed, with the beginning of tears in his bright eyes, as he added:
      &ldquo;There is more reason than ever, it seems to me, why I should go away from
      England! It is not kind to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His doleful tone and mien drove her to swift repentance. &ldquo;Oh, I have only
      been saying the disagreeable things first, to get them out of the way,&rdquo;
       she sought to reassure him. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t another unpleasant word for you
      to hear, not one, I promise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my opinion that there have been enough,&rdquo; he ventured to comment,
      with a rueful little smile. A measure of composure returned to him. &ldquo;But
      if they must be said, I would rather they come from you than from any one
      else, for I think that you have also some pleasant thoughts about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded her head several times in assent, regarding him with an amused
      twinkle in her eyes meanwhile. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;the right kind of editor could
      make very interesting stuff indeed out of you,&rdquo; she said, and smiled
      almost gaily at his visible failure to comprehend her figure. &ldquo;What I mean
      is&mdash;you are too much sail, and too little boat. You drift before
      every new wind that blows. There is lacking that kind of balance&mdash;proportion&mdash;which
      gives stability. But, dear me, it is a thousand times better to be like
      that, than to have an excess of the other thing. The man of the solid
      qualities, without the imagination, simply sticks in the mud where he was
      born. But with you&mdash;if the right person chances to get hold of you,
      and brings the right influences steadily to bear upon you, then there is
      no telling what fine things you may not rise to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are that right person!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his voice to utter these words, with the air of feeling them to
      be momentous. His eyes glowed as they reaffirmed the declaration to her
      inquiring glance. But she seemed to miss the gravity of both words and
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; she said, half jestingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too bad tempered
      and quarrelsome to exert any proper influence over any one. Why, I should
      nag all the joy and high spirits out of you in no time at all. No&mdash;you
      need an equable and happy person, really very wise and strong and
      sensible, but above all with an easy, smooth disposition&mdash;such a
      person, for example, as Emanuel&rsquo;s wife is described to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I need no one but you!&rdquo; he repeated with accentuated
      deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time she appeared to feel something of his intention. She looked into
      the gaze he was bending upon her and then withdrew her eyes precipitately,
      and made a show of active interest in her food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am asking you to think of joining your life to mine,&rdquo; he went on, in
      low, yet very distinct tones. &ldquo;You cannot know a hundredth part as well as
      I do, how profoundly I need such help as you can give. You are the one
      woman in the world who means strength as well as happiness to me. If you
      could only dream with what yearning I long always to lean upon you&mdash;to
      be supported by your fine, calm, sweet wisdom! To be upheld by you&mdash;to
      be nourished and guided by you&mdash;oh, that is the vision which I
      tremble with joy to think of! I am my own master for the first time to-day&mdash;I
      have taken my life into my own hands&mdash;and I lay it at your feet&mdash;dear
      lady&mdash;at your feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose abruptly while his last words were in the air, and turning, moved
      to the window. She had contrived by a gesture to bid him not to follow,
      and he could only gaze in mingled apprehension and hope at her back, the
      while she stood professing to scrutinize the shifting throng below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter brought in another dish, methodically rearranged the plates and
      went away again. To Christian&rsquo;s bitter disgust, two men entered and took
      seats at a table at the other end of the small room&mdash;and still she
      did not turn. He meditated calling her, or joining her on the pretense of
      announcing the cutlets&mdash;and only stared in nervous excitement
      instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as suddenly as she had left him she returned, and resumed her chair
      as if nothing unusual had happened. His strenuous gaze swept her face for
      tokens of her mood&mdash;of her inclination or decision&mdash;but beyond a
      spot of vivid red on each smooth cheek, there was no sign of any sort. Her
      frank, calm gray eyes met his with unruffled directness; they had in them
      that suggestion of benignant tolerance which he had discerned there more
      than once before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not answer me!&rdquo; he pleaded, after a few mouthfuls. As his back
      shielded the action from the strangers, he put forth a cautious hand to
      touch the nearest of hers, but she drew it gently away beyond his reach.
      They automatically adjusted their voices to the conditions created by the
      newcomers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There could be only one possible answer,&rdquo; she told him, softly, almost
      tenderly. &ldquo;It is a very flattering dream&mdash;? to me&mdash;but it is a
      mere empty dream, none the less. I hope you will not want to talk about it
      any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I swear that it is not empty at all!&rdquo; he urged, in earnest tones.
      &ldquo;Who has a right to say that it is a dream? I am my own master&mdash;so
      are you. We are of age&mdash;we are intelligent people. I deliberately
      come to you, and say to you that you are the one woman on earth whom I
      desire with all my heart for my wife. I open my mind to you. There is only
      the image of you inside it. You know my sincerity. You must feel how
      supreme is the place you have in my thoughts. It is the logical end toward
      which I have been walking ever since I first saw you! You are all that
      there is of true friendship, of true womanhood, for me! I put out my hands
      to you, I pray to you! And why will you not come to me, dear, dear Frank?&rdquo;
       There was a touch of pathos in the smile she gave him. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the least
      bit of good, I assure you,&rdquo; she made answer, in the confidential murmur
      that was necessary. &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t talk here&mdash;but please let us speak of
      something else. Or can we not go now?&rdquo; He went on as if she had not
      spoken, his big, dark eyes challenging hers to an encounter which she
      evaded. &ldquo;Do not think we need go away from England, if you want to stay;
      there will always be money enough&mdash;with your wisdom in controlling
      it. Perhaps we may even be able to restore Caermere. But if we are not,
      still it can be one of the noblest and most beautiful residences in
      England, when we learn together to understand its charm, and make it our
      home. Oh, when you see the magnificent hills and forests shutting it in on
      all sides&mdash;and the grim, fine old walls and towers of the castle
      itself! But there we need live only when we choose to do so&mdash;and
      whenever the mood comes to us, off we can roam to the Alps or Algiers, or
      the wonderful India which one always dreams of. And we shall sail in our
      own yacht and you shall be the queen there, as everywhere else. And all
      our lives we will spend in doing good to others: do you not see what
      extraordinary opportunities for helping those who need help you will have?
      Where now you are of service to one person, then you can assist a hundred!
      An army of grateful people will give thanks because of you&mdash;and I
      will always be the chief of them&mdash;your foremost slave, your most
      reverent worshiper! And then&mdash;think of the joy of a life in which no
      one has a share who is not pleasant and welcome to us! We will have no one
      near us who is not our friend. Oh, I have not told you: that is why, this
      very morning, I decided to leave it all, and to make a new life for
      myself, and to spend it wholly with my real friends. It is loneliness,
      heart and soul loneliness, that has driven me to revolt. And in my despair
      I come to you&mdash;and I say to you that it is friendship that I cannot
      live without, and you are my oldest friend, my dearest, truest, most
      precious friend, and I beg you to come with me and we will go through the
      world together, hand in hand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him by pushing back her chair and half rising. &ldquo;If you
      will excuse me now,&rdquo; she said, nervously, &ldquo;I think I must go. You mustn&rsquo;t
      trouble to come&mdash;I will say good-bye here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had risen as well, and now in trembling earnestness protested against
      her proposal. At the risk of attracting the attention of the strangers, he
      displayed such resentful opposition that she yielded. The waiter was
      summoned&mdash;and remained bowing in dazed meditation upon the magnitude
      of the change he had been bidden to keep for himself, after they had
      passed out and down the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      She led the way at a hurried pace back across the Circus and to
      Blackfriars. At the rounded beginning of the Embankment she paused, and
      for the first time spoke. &ldquo;Really I would rather go back by myself,&rdquo; she
      told him. &ldquo;It is only unhappiness to both of us&mdash;what you insist on
      talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do not think it is to be treated in this way,&rdquo; he declared with
      dignity. &ldquo;If we speak of nothing else it is the highest and most solemn
      honor that a man can pay to any woman, that I have paid to you. I have the
      feeling that it should be more courteously dealt with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; she admitted, nodding her ready compunction. She tightened
      her lips and looked away from him toward the bridge, her brows drawn
      together in troubled lines. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say the right thing to you&mdash;I
      know that better even than you do. You must not think I fail to appreciate
      it all&mdash;the honor, and the immense confidence, and all the rest of
      it. But when I have said that much&mdash;then I don&rsquo;t know in the least
      how to say the rest. Why can&rsquo;t we leave it unsaid altogether? I assure
      you, in all seriousness, that it can&rsquo;t be&mdash;and mayn&rsquo;t we leave it
      like that? Please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He regarded her with a patient yet proud sadness, waiting to speak till
      she had turned, and his glance caught hers. &ldquo;I do not wish to become a
      nuisance to you,&rdquo; he said, his voice choking a little, &ldquo;but I think it
      would be better if you said everything to me. Then I shall not put my mind
      on the rack, to try and imagine your reasons.&rdquo; He let his lip curl with a
      lingering ironical perception of the fantastic with which his tragedy was
      veined. &ldquo;It is very sweet,&rdquo; he went on&mdash;&ldquo;your consideration for my
      feelings. But I have heard so many plain truths to-day, I think my
      sensibilities are in good training now&mdash;they will not suffer for a
      few more.&rdquo; Suddenly, as if the sound of his voice had unnerved him, he
      seized her arm, and confronted her surprised gaze with a reddened and
      scowling face. &ldquo;What are you afraid of?&rdquo; he demanded hoarsely. &ldquo;Why not
      say it? I heard it only last night! It is forty years old, it is true, but
      they have wonderful memories in England. You are the one whom I have held
      to be my dearest friend&mdash;but go on! Say it to me! A little thing like
      friendship does not prevent you from thinking it! Why, then, you should
      have the courage to speak it out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dimly, while she stared in his distracted countenance, the meaning, of the
      wild talk dawned upon her. With a startled exclamation, she dragged her
      arm from his clutch, and drew back a step. Trembling in her agitation, her
      gray eyes distended themselves out of all likeness to their tranquil
      habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh-h-h!&rdquo; she murmured in dismay at him, and wrung her hands. &ldquo;Oh-h! Stop!
      Stop! That is too horrible for you to think!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaining coherence of thought and purpose, she moved impulsively to him,
      and in turn clasped her hand upon his arm. &ldquo;Put that out of your mind!&rdquo;
       she adjured him. &ldquo;I could not look anybody in the face if you thought <i>that</i>
      of me. Oh, it is too terrible of you! How could you suppose that I could
      harbor such a thought? To blame you for something years before you were
      born!&mdash;to throw it into your face. And <i>me</i> of all people! Why,
      I have cried to myself at remembering what you said about your father when
      we first met&mdash;how your little-boy memory clung affectionately to the
      soldier-figure of him in the door-way! Look at me&mdash;I cry now to think
      of it! Why, it is the one thing about you that is sacred to me!&mdash;the
      one thing that you are perfect in&mdash;and then you imagine that I am
      capable of insulting you about it! Oh, heavens, why wouldn&rsquo;t you leave me
      when I told you to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw his arm from her in a gust of physical impatience, but the
      glance with which, on the instant, she corrected this demonstration, was
      full of honest compassion. He groveled before this benign gaze, with bowed
      head and outstretched, pleading hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me! Forgive me!&rdquo; he groaned, brokenly. &ldquo;I could not&mdash;at all&mdash;know
      what it was I said. I am too unhappy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she began, with a vehement effort at calmness, &ldquo;let us say
      good-bye here. There are some Germans watching us from the hotel windows.
      Or it is better perhaps&mdash;will you walk on past the school?&rdquo; As they
      moved forward, she recovered more of her self-possession. &ldquo;I hope you will
      be able to remember something pleasant out of our morning,&rdquo; she said, and
      with a joyless laugh added, &ldquo;but for the life of me, I don&rsquo;t know what it
      can be. Or yes, you can remember when you woke up, and I stood and scolded
      you, from above the flowers. I pretended to bully you, but really all the
      while I was thinking how sweet of you the entire thing was. And later, too&mdash;oh,
      there were several intervals in which I behaved civilly to you for whole
      minutes at a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked wistfully at her. Beneath the forced playfulness of her tone it
      seemed to him that something hopeful sounded. &ldquo;Ah, dear friend,&rdquo; he
      murmured, drawing close to her&mdash;&ldquo;think!&mdash;think tenderly in my
      behalf! Ask yourself&mdash;your kindest self&mdash;if I must be really
      driven away. Why is it that I may not stay? I plead with you as if it were
      for my life&mdash;and is it not indeed for my life?&mdash;my very life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;Christian,&rdquo; she said, gravely, &ldquo;it is not your life, nor
      anything like your life. You give big labels to your emotions, but in good
      time you will see that the things themselves are not so big, or so vital.
      And you mustn&rsquo;t yield so readily to all these impulses to mope and despair
      and to think yourself ill used. You must try to make for yourself a
      thicker skin&mdash;and to view things more calmly. And I don&rsquo;t want you to
      go away thinking hard things of me. Is it true that I always nag you&mdash;there
      is something in you which calls out all the bully in me&mdash;but I wish
      you would think of me as your friend. It gives me great pleasure when you
      speak of me as your oldest friend in England&mdash;for I have always liked
      you, and I am interested in you, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why will you not marry me?&rdquo; He interposed the question bluntly, and
      with a directness which gave it the effect of an obstacle in her path,
      isolated but impassable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She halted, and studied the pavement in consideration of her reply. When
      she looked up, it was with the veiled elation of a disputant who has his
      counter-stroke well in hand. &ldquo;You said to-day that you had become your own
      master, and that you were a free man, with your life in your own hands.
      Very well. I also am my own master, and I am a free woman. My life is
      exclusively my own personal property, to live as I choose to live it. I
      value my liberty quite as highly as if I were a man. It does not suit me
      to merge any part of it in something else. There could be many other
      reasons given, no doubt, but they would be merely individual variations of
      this one chief reason&mdash;that I am a free woman, and intend to remain a
      free woman. I know what I want to do in the world, and I am going to try
      to do it, always my own way, always my own master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He regarded her thoughtfully, bowing his head in token of comprehension.
      &ldquo;But if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and then checked himself, with a gesture
      of pained submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no &lsquo;ifs,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said, with resolute calmness, and held out her
      hand to him. Her control of the situation was undisputed. &ldquo;We say
      good-bye, now&mdash;and we are friends&mdash;good friends. I&mdash;I thank
      you&mdash;for everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood looking at her as she walked away&mdash;a sedately graceful
      figure, erect and light of step, receding from him under the pallid green
      shelter of the young trees. Musingly, he held up the hand which still
      preserved the sense of that farewell contact with hers&mdash;and upon a
      sudden impulse put it to his lips and kissed it. Something in the action
      wrought an instantaneous change in his thoughts. All at once it was
      apparent to him that many things which should have been said to her he had
      left unsaid. In truth, it seemed upon reflection that he had said and done
      everything wrong. The notion of running after her flamed up in him for a
      moment. She was still in sight&mdash;he could distinguish her in the
      distance, stopping to buy a paper from a boy near the Temple station. But
      then the memory of her unanswerable, irrevocable &ldquo;No&rdquo; swept back upon him&mdash;and
      with a long sigh he turned and strode in the other direction.

      Frances, hastening mechanically toward her office, found relief from the
      oppressive confusion of her thoughts in the fortuitous spectacle of two
      small newsboys fighting in the gutter just at the end of the Temple
      Gardens. For the first time in her life, the sight aroused nothing within
      her save a pleased if unscientific interest. She paused, and almost
      smilingly observed the contest. She found something amusingly grotesque in
      the pseudo-Titanic rage on these baby faces. The dramatic fury of the
      embattled infants was in such ridiculous disproportion to the
      feather-weight blows they exchanged! She found herself chuckling aloud at
      some incongruous comparison which rose in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the combatants parted, apparently for no better reason than the
      general volatility of youth, she remembered that she had it in mind to
      look at the &ldquo;Star.&rdquo; One of her friends, Mary Leach, had sent to that paper
      some days before an article on &ldquo;Shopgirls&rsquo; Dormitories,&rdquo; and she was
      interested in watching for its appearance. It happened that one of the
      boys had a &ldquo;Star.&rdquo; Acting upon some obscure whim, she gave them each a
      penny, quite in the manner of a distributor of prizes for conspicuous
      merit&mdash;and grinned to herself at the thought when she had turned her
      back on them and moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sign of what she sought on the front page. Opening the sheet,
      her eye fell, as it were, upon a news paragraph in a middle column:
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Death of the Oldest Duke.&mdash;The Shrewsbury correspondent of the
      &lsquo;Exchange Telegraph&rsquo; announces the death at Caermere Castle, at an early
      hour this morning, of the Duke of Glastonbury. His Grace, who was in his
      ninetieth year, had until last summer enjoyed the most vigorous health,
      and only now succumbs to the prostration then occasioned by the group of
      domestic bereavements which at the time created such a sensation. The
      deceased nobleman, who for the great part of his prolonged life, was one
      of the best known sportsmen in Shropshire, succeeded his father as eighth
      duke in his minority, and had been in possession of the title for no less
      than seventeen years when Her Majesty ascended the throne, thus
      constituting a record which is believed to be without parallel in the
      annals of the peerage. His successor is stated by Whitaker&rsquo;s Almanac to be
      his grandson, Mr. Christian Tower, but the current editions of Burke,
      Debrett and others do not mention this gentleman, whose claims, it would
      appear, have but recently been admitted by the family.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances read it all, as she stood at the corner, with a curious sense of
      mental sluggishness. Her attention failing to follow one of the sentences,
      she went back, and laboriously traced its entire tortuous course, only to
      find that it meant no more than it had at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a long time before she connected the intelligence on the printed
      page with the realities of actual life. Then she turned swiftly, and
      strained her eyes in the wild hope of discovering Christian still on the
      Embankment. She even took a few hurried steps, as if to follow and
      overtake him&mdash;but stopped short, confronted by the utter futility of
      such an enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, walking slowly, her mind a maze of wondering thoughts, she went her
      way.

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>hristian strolled
      aimlessly about for a long time in the closely packed congeries of
      streets, little and big, behind St. Paul&rsquo;s. It happened to be all new
      ground to him, and something novel was welcome to his troubled and
      restless mind. He loitered from one window to another, examining their
      contents gravely; at the old book stalls he took down numbers of volumes
      and looked laboriously through them, as if conducting an urgent search for
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      His jumbled thoughts were a burden to him. He could get nothing coherent
      from them, It was not even clear to his perception whether he was really
      as dejected and disconsolate as he ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had only recently been plunged into despairing depths of sadness, and
      it was fitting that he should still be racked with anguish. Yet there was
      no actual pain&mdash;there was not even a dogged insensibility to the
      frivolous distractions of the moment. He became exceedingly interested in
      an old copy of Boutell, for example, and hunted eagerly through the
      multitude of heraldic cuts to see if the white bull on a green ground of
      the Torrs was among them. His disappointment at not finding it was so keen
      that for the instant it superseded his abiding grief. His discovery of
      this fact entertained him; he was almost capable of laughing in amusement
      at it. Then, in self-condemnation, he sought to call up before his mental
      vision the picture of Frances, as she had looked when they had said
      good-bye. The image would not come distinctly. Her face eluded him; he
      could only see her walking away, instead, under the feeble green of the
      young trees. None the less, he said deliberately to himself that he was
      unhappy beyond the doom of most men, and that the hope had gone out of his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day had turned out unexpectedly warm. In the middle of his shapeless
      musings, the ornate sign of a Munich brewery on a cool, shaded doorway
      suddenly attracted him. The dusky, restful emptiness of the place inside
      seemed ideally to fit his mood. He went in, and seated himself with a long
      sigh of satisfaction at one of the tables. Here, in this mellow quiet,
      over the refreshing contents of the big, covered stone mug, he could think
      peacefully and to advantage. He lit a cigar, and leaning back in comfort,
      gave the signal to his thoughts to arrange and concentrate themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should he do next? Yes&mdash;that was far more to the point than
      mooning over the irrevocable past. He had left Duke Street with hardly any
      plan beyond not returning thither. Luggage of some sort he would have to
      have&mdash;changes of linen and the like, and the necessary articles of
      the toilet. It was his intention to buy these as the need of them arose&mdash;and
      the character of his purchases would also depend a good deal, of course,
      upon the decision he should come to concerning his movements. He had said
      that he would leave England&mdash;and now he asked himself whether there
      was anything to prevent his departure that very evening. One of the
      deepest charms of travel must be to start off on the instant, upon the
      bidding of the immediate whim, and descend upon your destination before
      there has been time to cheapen it by thinking about it. Why should he not
      eat the morrow&rsquo;s breakfast in the Hague&mdash;and dine at Amsterdam?
      Similarly, he could within twenty-four hours be watching the marriage of
      Mosel and Rhine at Coblenz&mdash;or gazing upon the wide, wet, white sands
      of the Norman shore from the towering battlements of St. Michel. A hundred
      storied towns, vaguely pictured in his imagination, beckoned to him from
      across the Channel. Upon reflection, it seemed to him that Holland offered
      the most wooing invitation. He asked the waiter for Bradshaw, and noted
      the salient points of the itinerary from Queen borough.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now three o&rsquo;clock. There was plenty of time for all purchases, and
      a leisurely dinner before going to Victoria. It occurred to him that the
      dinner must be very good&mdash;a luxurious kind of farewell repast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would make a memorandum now of the things he ought to buy here in
      London. Holland was by all accounts a dear place&mdash;and moreover he had
      heard that the Dutch customs examination was by no means troublesome. It
      would be more intelligent to complete practically his outfit here. He took
      out a pencil, and began feeling in his coat-pocket for a bit of paper. The
      hand brought out, beside Lady Milly&rsquo;s note about the Private View, three
      or four unopened letters. He had entirely forgotten their existence&mdash;and
      stared at them now in puzzled indecision. It was not a sensible thing, or
      a fair thing either, to tear up and destroy unread the message which some
      one else had been at pains to transcribe for you. But on the other hand,
      these missives belonged to the stupid and intolerable life in Duke Street,
      with which he had definitely parted company. It might even be said, in one
      sense, that he was not the person to whom they were addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      By some whimsical freak of the brain, he suddenly asked himself whether he
      should not go to Greece instead of Holland, and enlist as a volunteer in
      the war against the Turks. He became on the instant immersed in
      adventurous military speculations. He had not fallen into the English
      habit of following the daily papers with regularity, and he was conscious
      of no responsibility whatever toward the events of the world at large, as
      Reuter and the correspondents chronicled them. Something of this new war
      in Thessaly, however, he had perforce read and heard. Of the circumstances
      and politics surrounding this latest eruption of the Eastern Question he
      knew little more than would any of the young Frenchmen of education among
      whom he had spent his youth. But in an obscure way, he comprehended that
      good people in Western Europe always sympathized with the Christian as
      against the Moslem. It seemed that some generous-minded young Englishmen
      were already translating this sympathy into action; somewhere he had seen
      an account of a party of volunteers leaving London for Athens, and being
      cheered by their friends at the station. Now that he thought of it, the
      paper in which he had read the report had ridiculed the affair as an
      undesirable kind of a joke&mdash;but the impulse of the volunteers seemed
      fine to him, none the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      There ought to be some martial blood in his veins; the soldier-figure of
      his father rose before him in affirmation of the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no&mdash;what nonsense it was! If ever there had been a youth bred and
      narrowed to the walks of peace, he was that young person. He who had never
      struck another human being in his life, that he could remember&mdash;what
      would such a tame sheep be doing in the open field, against the unknown,
      ferocious Osmanli Turk? The gross absurdity of the picture flared upon
      him, momentarily&mdash;and then the whole notion of armed adventure had
      vanished from his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      His attention reverted to the letters&mdash;and now it seemed quite a
      matter of course that he should open them. The first three were of no
      importance. The fourth he regarded with wide-open eyes, after he had
      grasped the identity of the writer. He read it over slowly, more than
      once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;27A Ashley Gardens, S. W., Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Dear Mr. Christian Tower: I have taken this little place in town for
      the time being, and I shall be glad to see you when you are this way.
      To-morrow, Tuesday, is a day when I shall not be at home to other people&mdash;if
      you have nothing better to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours very sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edith Cressage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing better to do? Christian&rsquo;s thoughts lingered rather blankly upon
      the phrase&mdash;until all at once he perceived that there could not
      possibly be anything better to do. He rose with decision, hurriedly gulped
      what remained of his second pot of beer, paid his bill and marched out
      with the air of a man with a mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hansom, he read the letter still again, and leaned backward to see
      as much as possible of himself in the little mirror at the side. His chin
      could not be described as closely shaven, and his garments were certainly
      not those of the afternoon caller. The resource of stopping at Duke Street
      occurred to him&mdash;but no! that would be too foolish. The whole
      significance of the day would be abolished, wiped out, by such a fatuous
      step. And he repeated to himself that it <i>was</i> a day of supreme
      significance. By comparison with the proceedings and experiences of this
      long and crowded day, the rest of his life seemed colorless indeed. And
      what was of most importance in it, he declared to himself, was not its
      external happenings, but the fine and novel posture of his liberated mind
      toward them. He was for the first time actually a free man. His
      enfranchisement had not been thrown at him by outsiders; it proceeded from
      within him&mdash;the product of his own individuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what people would discern in him hereafter&mdash;a complete and
      self-sufficient personality. He would no longer be pointed out and
      classified as somebody&rsquo;s grandson&mdash;somebody&rsquo;s cousin or grand-nephew.
      The world would recognize him as being himself. He felt assured, for
      example, upon reflection that Lady Cressage would not dream of questioning
      the fashion of the clothes in which he came to see her. She would perceive
      at once that he had developed beyond the silly pupilary stage of
      subordination to his coat and hat. She was so clever and sympathetic a
      woman, he felt intuitively, that these symbols of his emancipated
      condition would delight her. It was true, he saw again from the mirror
      that his collar might be a little whiter; his cuffs, too, had lost their
      earlier glow of starched freshness. But these were trifles to serious
      minds. And besides, was it not all in the family?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a momentary block at the corner of Parliament Street, and here a
      newsboy thrust a fourth edition upon Christian with such an effect of
      authority that he found a penny and took the paper. It was the
      &ldquo;Westminster Gazette,&rdquo; and when he had looked upon the second page for a
      possible drawing by Gould, and had skimmed the column of desultory gossip
      on the last page, which always seemed to his alien conceptions of
      journalism to be the kind of matter he liked in a newspaper, he laid the
      sheet on his knee, and resumed his idle reverie. To his great surprise the
      cabman&rsquo;s shouts through the roof were necessary to awaken him at Ashley
      Gardens. He shook himself, laughingly explained that he had been up all
      night as he paid his fare, and ascended the steps of 27A, paper in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant seemed prepared for his coming, for upon giving his name in
      response to her somewhat meaning inquiry, she led him in at once. He sat
      waiting for a few moments in a small and conveniently appointed
      drawing-room, and then stood up, at the rustle of rapid skirts which
      announced Lady Cressage in the half-open doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered with outstretched hand, and a radiant welcome upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian noted that beyond the hand there was a forearm, shapely and
      cream-hued, disclosed by the lace of her flowing sleeve. There were
      billows of this lace, and of some fragile, light fabric which seemed
      sister to it, enveloping the lady, yet her tall, graceful figure was in
      some indefinable way molded to the eye beneath them all. The pale hair was
      as he had first seen it, loosely drawn across her temples; there were warm
      shadows in it which he had not thought to see. The face, too, had some
      unexpected phase, here in the subdued light of the curtained room. There
      was a sense of rosiness in the rounded flesh, a certain reposeful elation
      in the regard of the blue eyes, which put quite at fault the image of
      harrowed restlessness and nerves he had retained from Caermere. It was in
      an illuminating second that he saw all this, and perceived that she was
      very beautiful, and flushed with the deep consciousness that she read his
      thoughts like big print.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the greatest cheek in the world&mdash;my summoning you like this,&rdquo;
       she said, as they shook hands. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;sit here. Put your hat and paper
      on the sofa. This is my only reception room&mdash;but we might have a
      little more light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved to the window, to pull back the curtains, and then about the
      room, lightly rearranging some of the chairs and trinkets&mdash;all with a
      buoyant daintiness of motion which inexpressibly charmed him. &ldquo;These are
      not my things, you know,&rdquo; she explained over her shoulder. &ldquo;I am not
      trying in the least to live up to them, either. I take the place,
      furnished, for three months, from the widow of an Indian officer. You
      would think she would have some Indian things&mdash;but it might have all
      come direct from Tottenham Court Road. It&rsquo;s impossible to get the
      slightest sensation of being at home, here. One could really extract more
      domesticity out of four bare cottage walls. Or no, what am I saying?&rdquo;&mdash;she
      had returned, and sinking into the low chair opposite him, pointed her
      words with a frank smile into his face&mdash;-&ldquo;it <i>is</i> a bit like
      home&mdash;to see you here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to be here,&rdquo; he assured her, nodding his unfeigned
      pleasure. &ldquo;But it seemed as if you would never tell me I might come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was worried to death. There were all sorts of things to see about
      when I first came up,&rdquo; she explained with animation. &ldquo;And I had the
      feeling that I didn&rsquo;t want you to come till I had smoothed some of my
      wrinkles out, and had achieved a certain control over my nerves. It was
      not fair to myself&mdash;the view you had of me at Caermere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The view of her that was afforded him here brought a glow of admiration to
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think of your being my cousin!&rdquo; he said, with some remote echo in his
      own voice of the surprise which he recalled in Dicky Westland&rsquo;s tone. It
      seemed wonderful indeed as he looked at her, and smiled. He shook his head
      presently, in response to her question whether he had any recent news from
      Caermere, and continued to observe her with a rapt sense of the miraculous
      being embodied before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the duke is very low indeed,&rdquo; she told him in a hushed voice. &ldquo;I had
      it yesterday from&mdash;from one of the household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tidings barely affected him. That side of his mind was still fast in
      the rut of last night&rsquo;s mutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have quite decided to go away,&rdquo; he announced, calmly. &ldquo;I get no good
      out of the life here. It does not suit me. Whatever comes to me, why, that
      I shall accept, but to use it in my own way, living my own life. Now that
      I am a free man, it astonishes me that I did not rebel long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rebel&mdash;against what?&rdquo; she asked him, with a kind of confidential
      candor which put him even more at his ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, against everything,&rdquo; he smiled back at her. &ldquo;This existence that they
      arranged for me&mdash;it is like being embalmed and wrapped in
      mummy-cloths. Personally I do not survive a thousand years&mdash;but I am
      but one link in a long chain of respectable people who have lived like
      that, without living at all, for many thousands. It is being buried alive.
      Why, you will see what I mean&mdash;a man is a creature different from
      other human creatures. He has an individual nature of his own. His tastes,
      his inclinations, his impulses and ideas, are not quite like those of the
      people about him. He would be happy to follow these according to his own
      wishes. But then everybody seizes upon him and says: &lsquo;No, you must be and
      do just like the rest. You will be noticed and disliked if you indulge in
      even the slightest variation. These are the coats you are to wear, and the
      hats and caps and neckties. This is Duke Street, which you must live in.
      This is the hour to get up, this is the hour to make calls, this is the
      corner of your card to turn down, this is the list of people at whose
      houses you must dine, these are your friends ready-made for you out of a
      book.&rsquo; And truly what is it all?&mdash;utter, utter emptiness. You are
      really not alive at all! You have no more personal sensation of your own
      existence than an insect. It is all this that I rebel against.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reclined a little in her chair, and covered him with a meditative
      gaze. &ldquo;I know the feeling,&rdquo; she commented thoughtfully. &ldquo;I used to have
      sharp spasms of it&mdash;oh, ages ago&mdash;whenever a shopwoman showed me
      something, and said, &lsquo;This is very much worn just now,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;We are
      selling a great deal of this.&rsquo; Then I would not have that particular thing
      if I died for it. But do you really feel so earnestly about it?&rdquo; She put
      the question in deference to a gesture by which he had signified the
      inadequacy of her comparison. &ldquo;Ah, the real life, as you call it, is a
      more complicated thing than one fancies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is precisely the point,&rdquo; with vivacity. &ldquo;I have thought much
      about that. Is it not the artificial life which is complicated instead? Do
      we not confound the two? If you consider it, what can be more simple that
      the natural life of a man? If an astronomer, for example, has a difficult
      problem to work out, he first busies himself in discovering and putting
      aside all the things which seem to be factors in it but really are not.
      One by one he gets rid of them, until at last he has the naked equation
      before him&mdash;and then a result is possible. But with us, it seems that
      we go quite the other way about it. We take the problem of life&mdash;which
      is extraordinarily simple to begin with&mdash;and we pile upon it and
      around it thousands of outside rules and conventions and traditions, and
      we confuse it with other thousands of prejudices, and insincerities, and
      old mistakes that no one has had the industry to examine&mdash;and then we
      look with embarrassment at what we have done, and shake our heads, and say
      that the problem is too hard, that it passes the wisdom of man to solve
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you joy of solving it,&rdquo; she remarked, after another reflective
      survey of his face. &ldquo;I am sure I wish some one would do it. But you spoke
      of going away. How would that help matters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The recurrence of the question startled him. He looked at her with lifted
      head, recalling swiftly meanwhile the tone in which Frances had uttered
      those same words. A blurred, imperfect retrospect of the morning&rsquo;s events
      and talks passed fleetingly across his mind&mdash;and its progress
      disquieted him. Some tokens of perturbation on his face seemed to warn
      her, for she went on without waiting for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not surprised to find you feeling like this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is quite
      the effect that I imagined London would produce upon you. I have no right
      to say so, perhaps, but it seemed to me from the start that it was being
      badly managed&mdash;I mean the way you were sent here by yourself, and
      given nothing to do except follow about where Lord Lingfield led. It is
      not what I should have done&mdash;but the truth is that Emanuel knows
      nothing at all about the characters and temperaments of human beings. If
      men agree with him, he thinks they are good men, and if they disagree with
      him, they are bad men&mdash;or at least not worth thinking about at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had quite resolved not to commit myself to his System,&rdquo; Christian
      informed her, &ldquo;even before I made up my mind to&mdash;to take other
      steps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His closing euphemism seemed to attract her attention. &ldquo;What is it you
      intend to do?&rdquo; she asked of him, softly. She sat upright again, with an
      air of friendly curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the face of this query, he discovered that his intentions were by no
      means so clear to himself as they had been. &ldquo;It is still rather in the
      air,&rdquo; he said vaguely. &ldquo;But we talk always of myself! Tell me, instead,
      about yourself! It is an infinitely more pleasing subject. You are here in
      London for only three months? And you are alone here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled in an indefinite fashion, and leaned back in her chair. &ldquo;Ought
      I to have a chaperon? I dare say. But there is no room for her here. The
      flat accommodates just one solitary elderly lady and here you behold her.
      Oh, I am a hundred years old, I assure you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could only wave his hand at her in genial deprecation. &ldquo;Oh, who is
      younger than you?&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed. &ldquo;By the almanac I am four-and-twenty,&rdquo; she went on, with a new
      note of gentle melancholy. &ldquo;But by my own feelings, I seem to have been
      left over from the reign of William the Fourth. And really, it is not my
      own feelings alone&mdash;when I go out, I observe that very old men take
      me down to dinner, and talk to me precisely as if I were a contemporary of
      theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we were together at Caermere,&rdquo; interposed Christian, &ldquo;you confessed
      to me that you were not happy&mdash;and it was my great delight to pledge
      myself that if ever there was anything I could do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is nothing at all,&rdquo; she interrupted him to declare. &ldquo;My case
      will not come up. It has all been settled. The accounts, or settlements&mdash;or
      whatever you call them&mdash;have been made up, and my share of my
      husband&rsquo;s share of his father&rsquo;s interest in <i>his</i> father&rsquo;s estate has
      been ascertained. I have six hundred a year for life. It is a mild and
      decorous competence. I do not complain. It will keep a genteel roof over
      my head here in London, or a small house and a pony-trap in the country.
      It will run to a month at a pension in the cheaper parts of Switzerland,
      or perhaps even to a lodging and a bath-chair at Brighton, when it is not
      quite the season. Oh, I shall get on very well indeed&mdash;at all
      events,&rdquo; she added with a touch of bitterness, &ldquo;much better than I deserve
      to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian lifted his brows in protesting inquiry. &ldquo;You always speak in
      that tone of yourself! It pains me to hear you. I cannot think of any one
      who deserves the kindness and friendly good offices of fortune more than
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage gave an uncertain little laugh. &ldquo;You are too generous-minded&mdash;too
      innocent. You do not know. Me? My dear friend&mdash;I have committed the
      unpardonable sin! I humiliated and degraded myself to win a great prize in
      the world&rsquo;s lottery&mdash;and I did not bring it off. That is my offense.
      If I had won the trick&mdash;why, they would be burning incense before me!
      But I lost instead&mdash;and they leave me quite by myself to digest my
      own disgust. I don&rsquo;t talk about it&mdash;I have never said as much to any
      living soul as I am saying to you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why I am telling you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any one else who would listen with such sympathy?&rdquo; Christian
      heard himself interjecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is too cruel,&rdquo; continued Lady Cressage, &ldquo;too shameful a story! I
      was not happy at home. It was nobody&rsquo;s fault in particular; I don&rsquo;t know
      that we were more evil-tempered and selfish among ourselves than most
      other middle-class households with four hundred a year, and three
      daughters to marry off. I was the youngest, and I had the sort of good
      looks which were in fashion at the moment, and mamma worked very hard for
      me&mdash;pretending to idolize me before people though we yapped at each
      other like fox-terriers in private&mdash;and I was lucky in making friends&mdash;and
      so I went swimming out on the top of the wave that season, the most envied
      poor fool of a girl in London. And when Cressage wanted to marry me&mdash;I
      was dizzy with the immensity of what seemed to be offered me. My parents
      were mad with pride and ecstasy. Everybody around me pretended a kind of
      holy joy at my triumph. I give you my word!&mdash;never so much as a
      whisper came to my ears of any shadow of a reason why I should hesitate&mdash;why
      I should think a second time! Do you see? There was not an honest person&mdash;a
      single woman or a man with decency enough to warn an ignorant girl of her
      danger&mdash;within reach of me anywhere. They all kept as silent as the
      grave&mdash;with that lying grin of congratulation on their mean faces&mdash;and
      they led me to be married to the beast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had sat erect in her chair as she spoke, and now she rose to her feet,
      motioning him not to get up as she did so. She took a restless step or
      two, her shoulders trembling with excitement, and her hands clenched.
      &ldquo;Ah-h! I will never forgive them the longest day of my life!&rdquo; she called
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a determined shake of her head, she seemed to master herself.
      Standing before a small mirror in the panel of a cabinet against the wall,
      she busied her beautiful hands in correcting the slight disorder of her
      hair. When she turned to him, it was with a faint, tremulous smile
      surmounting the signs of stress and agitation upon her face. She sank into
      the chair again, with a long-drawn breath of resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t nice to abuse the dead,&rdquo; she remarked, striving after an
      effect of judicial fairness in her voice. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to speak like
      that. And for that matter, why should I speak at all of him? One doesn&rsquo;t
      blame a wolf for man-eating. You execrate instead the people who
      deliberately throw a helpless human being to the wolf. I even say to
      myself that I have no quarrel with Cressage. He was as God made him&mdash;if
      the thought isn&rsquo;t blasphemous. He was a great, overgrown, bullying,
      blubbering, ignorant boy, who never got beyond the morals of the stables
      and kennels, and the standards of taste of the servants&rsquo; hall. One could
      hardly call him vicious; that is to say, he did not deliberately set out
      to cause suffering. He did not do anything on deliberation. He acted just
      as his rudimentary set of barbaric impulses prompted him to act. Some of
      these impulses would have been regarded as virtues in a more intelligent
      man. For example, he was wildly, insanely jealous of me. It took the most
      impossible and vulgar forms, it is true, but still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, need we talk of him?&rdquo; It was with almost a groan of supplication that
      Christian stopped her. &ldquo;He is too unpleasant to think about. Nothing that
      I had heard of him before made me sorry that he was dead&mdash;but this&mdash;it
      is too painful. But now you are a free woman&mdash;you see your path well
      before you, to travel as you choose. And what will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed and threw up her hands with a gesture of contemptuous
      indifference. &ldquo;What does any English lady with six hundred a year do?
      Devote her energies to seeing that she gets&mdash;let me see, what is the
      sum?&mdash;to seeing that she gets twelve thousand shillings&rsquo; worth of
      respectable discomfort, and secures reasonable opportunities for making
      those about her uncomfortable also. Oh, I don&rsquo;t in the least know what I
      shall do. The truth is,&rdquo; she added, with a sad smile, &ldquo;I have lived alone
      with my dislikes so long, and I have nourished and watered them so
      carefully, that now they fill my whole garden. They have quite choked out
      the flowers of existence&mdash;these thick, rank, powerful weeds. And I
      haven&rsquo;t the energy&mdash;perhaps I haven&rsquo;t even the desire&mdash;to pull
      them up. They seem appropriate, somehow&mdash;they belong to the
      desolation that has been made of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian bent forward, and made a movement as if to take one of the hands
      which lay dejectedly in her lap. He did not do this, but touched a
      projecting bit of lace upon one of the flounces of her gown, and twisted
      it absent-mindedly in his fingers instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are still unhappy!&rdquo; he said reproachfully, his eyes glowing with the
      intensity of his tender compassion. &ldquo;I do not forgive myself for my
      inability to be of help to you. It is incredible that there is not
      something I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are going away,&rdquo; she reminded him, in a soft monotone. &ldquo;You have
      your own unpleasantnesses to think of&mdash;and you are occupied with
      plans for rearranging your life on new lines. I only hope that you will
      find the happiness you are setting out in search of. But then men can
      always get what they want, if they are only sufficiently in earnest about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not entirely settled that I shall go away,&rdquo; said Christian. He
      twisted the lace in the reverse direction, and hesitated over his further
      words. &ldquo;That was only one of several alternatives. I am clear only about
      my resolve to make a stand&mdash;to break away. But if I remained here in
      England&mdash;in London?&rdquo;&mdash;He looked with mingled trepidation and
      inquiry into her face. &ldquo;If I did not go abroad&mdash;is there anything I
      could do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She regarded with attentiveness the hand which was playing havoc with her
      flounce&mdash;and it straightway desisted. She continued to study the
      little screwed-up cone of lace, in meditative silence. At last she shook
      her head. &ldquo;You must not give it another thought,&rdquo; she said, but with no
      touch of dictation in her musing tone. Her eyes dwelt upon him with a
      remote and ruminating gaze. &ldquo;I belong to a past generation. My chances in
      the lottery are all exhausted&mdash;things of the past. You must not
      bother about me. And I think you ought to give up those ideas of yours
      about breaking away, as you call it. London hasn&rsquo;t been made pleasant for
      you, simply because the wrong people have gone the wrong way about it to
      arrange matters for you. But there are extremely nice people among the set
      you know, if you once understood them. With your position, you can command
      any kind of associations you wish to have. After it is all said and done,
      I think England has its full share of cultivated and refined people of
      intelligence. I have not seen much of the Continent, but I do not believe
      that it possesses any superiority over us in that respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in your own case,&rdquo; urged Christian, somewhat hazily; &ldquo;you said that
      there were no honest people about you to warn you&mdash;though you were in
      the best society. That is my feeling&mdash;that you do not get the truth
      from them. They do not lie to you&mdash;but they are silent about the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it different elsewhere?&rdquo; she asked, gravely. &ldquo;Is not the young girl
      sold everywhere? Do you think that marriage is a more sacred and ethereal
      thing among the great families of France or Austria or Germany than it is
      with us? I have heard differently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we are all equally uncivilized about women,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I feel
      very strongly about that. But you, who have such knowledge and such clear
      opinions&mdash;would you not love to do something to alter this injustice
      to women? The thought has been much in my mind, of late.&rdquo; He paused to
      reflect in fleeting wonderment upon the fact that only this morning he had
      been absorbed in it. &ldquo;And my meaning is,&rdquo; he stumbled on, &ldquo;there is
      nothing I would rather devote my life to than the task of making existence
      easier and broader and more free for young women. Could there be any finer
      work than that? I know that it appeals to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with an element of doubt in her glance. &ldquo;Nothing appeals
      very much to me&mdash;and I&rsquo;m afraid my sex least of all. I do not like
      them, to tell the truth. I never get over the surprised disgust of waking
      up in the morning and finding that I am one of them. But this is rather
      wandering from the point, isn&rsquo;t it? I was urging you to give over the
      notion of making a demonstration. You have waited thus long; be content to
      wait just a little longer. My private belief is that the Duke will not
      live the week out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still, the assurance seemed to suggest nothing to him. &ldquo;But if he dies,&rdquo;
       he protested, &ldquo;how then will I be different? I am lonely&mdash;I am like a
      forlorn man escaped on a raft from a shipwreck&mdash;I eat my heart out in
      friendless solitude. And if I have a great title&mdash;why, then I shall
      be more alone than ever. It is that way with such men&mdash;I have seen
      that they hold themselves aloof&mdash;and others do not come freely near
      them. It frightens me&mdash;the thought of living without friends. I say
      to you solemnly that I would give it all&mdash;the position, the authority
      and dignity, the estates, Caermere, everything&mdash;for the assurance of
      one warm, human heart answering in every beat to mine! Has friendship
      perished out of the world, then? Or has it never existed, except in the
      books?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her beauty had never been so manifest to him, as now while he gazed at
      her, and she did not speak. There seemed the faint, delicate hint of a
      tenderness in the classical lines of the face that he had not seen before.
      It was as if his appeal had brought forth some latent aptitude of romance,
      to mellow the direct glance of her eyes, and soften in some subtle way the
      whole charm of her presence. A new magic was visible in her loveliness&mdash;and
      the sense that his words had conjured it into being thrilled him with a
      wistful pride. No woman had thus moved him heretofore. The perception that
      she was plastic to his mental touch&mdash;that this flower-like marvel of
      comeliness and grace, of exquisite tastes and pure dignity of soul, could
      be swayed by his suggestion, would vibrate at the tone of his voice&mdash;awed
      him as if he were confronted by a miracle. His breath came and went under
      a dull consciousness of pain&mdash;which was yet more like pleasure. A
      bell sounded somewhere within the house, and its brief crystal resonance
      seemed somehow to clarify the ferment of his thoughts. All at once, as by
      the flooding of sunlight into a darkened labyrinth, his mind was clear to
      him. He knew what he wanted&mdash;nay, what all the years had been leading
      him up to desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his gaze maintained upon her face&mdash;timidly yet with rapturous
      intentness, as if fearful of breaking the spell&mdash;he rose to his feet,
      and stood over her. A confusion of unspoken words trembled on his lips, as
      her slow glance lifted itself to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was like the pleasantry of a beautiful, roguish little girl&rdquo;&mdash;he
      began, smiling nervously down at her&mdash;&ldquo;your saying that you belonged
      to a generation earlier than mine. Do you think I do not know my
      generation? And am I blind, that I do not see what is most precious in it?
      This is what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An extraordinary outburst of disputing voices, in the little hallway close
      at hand, broke in upon his words. He stopped, stared inquiringly at Lady
      Cressage, and beheld her rise, frowning and hard-eyed, and step toward the
      door. A vague sense of the familiar came to him from the louder of the
      accents outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened, and the domestic, red-faced, and spluttering with
      wrath, began some stammered explanation to her mistress. What she sought
      to say did not appear, for on the instant the door was pushed farther
      back, and a veiled lady took up her energetic stand upon the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame her,&rdquo; this lady cried, in high, rapid tones. &ldquo;I forced my way
      in&mdash;something told me that you were at home. And when you hear my
      news&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, since you are here&rdquo;&mdash;Lady Cressage began, coldly. &ldquo;But, really,
      Mrs. Torr&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;call me Cora!&rdquo; the other interrupted, vivaciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went further, and bustling her arms against Edith&rsquo;s shoulders,
      purported to kiss her on both cheeks. Then, drawing back her head, she
      went on: &ldquo;My dear, the duke died at two this morning! It&rsquo;s in all the
      papers. But what isn&rsquo;t in any of the papers is that the heir is missing.
      It&rsquo;s a very curious story. Mr. Westland here&rdquo;&mdash;by her gesture it
      seemed that Dicky was behind her in the hallway&mdash;&ldquo;went to Duke Street
      this noon, and found Christian&rsquo;s man in great alarm. The youngster had
      bolted, leaving a note saying merely that he was called away. Mr.
      Westland&rsquo; then hunted me up, and we started out, for I had a kind of clue,
      don&rsquo;t you see. I knew where he was at ten o&rsquo;clock this forenoon&mdash;and
      we drove to Arundel Street, and there we found&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian hurriedly stepped forward. &ldquo;Oh, I think you may take it that I
      am not lost,&rdquo; he called out, revealing himself to the astonished Cora. For
      the moment the chief thing in his mind was satisfaction at having
      interrupted her disclosures about Arundel Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as other thoughts crowded in upon him, he straightened his shoulders
      and lifted his chin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said, with a reassuring wave of
      the hand toward the womenfolk of his family.

      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the morning of
      the funeral, six days later, Christian rose very early, and took coffee in
      his library shortly after seven. Then, lighting a cigarette, he resumed
      work upon several drawers full of papers, open on the big table, where it
      had been left off the previous evening. The details of the task seemed
      already familiar to him. He scanned one document after another with an
      informed eye, and put it in its proper pile without hesitation. He made
      notes suggested by the contents of each, on the pad before him, with a
      quill pen and corrected the vagaries of this unaccustomed implement, in
      the matter of blots and inadequate lines, with painstaking patience. There
      were steel nibs in abundance, and two gold stylographic pens, but he clung
      resolutely to the embarrassing feather.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time he rested from his labors, and rang the bell beside his desk;
      almost upon the instant Falkner appeared in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mr. Westland is up,&rdquo; said Christian, &ldquo;you may ask him to join me
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Your Grace,&rdquo; the smooth-voiced, soft-mannered man replied, and
      vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young duke rose, yawned slightly and moved to the window nearest him.
      It opened, upon examination, and he stepped out on a narrow balcony of
      stone which skirted the front of the square tower he had quitted. The
      outlook seemed to be to the northeast, for a patch of sunshine lay upon
      the outer edge of the balcony at the right. Breathing in delightedly the
      fresh Maymorning air, he gazed upon the bold prospect of hills receding in
      lifted terraces high against the remote sky-line. He had not seen just
      this view from Caermere before&mdash;and he said to himself that it was
      finer than all the others. Above each lateral stretch of purplish-gray
      granite, to the farthest distance, there ran a band of cool green foliage&mdash;the
      inexpressibly tender green of young birch trees; their thin, chalk-white
      stems were revealed in delicate tracery against indefinable sylvan
      shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the early stillness, he could hear the faint murmur of the Devon,
      gurgling in the depths of the ravine between him and the nearest hill.
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;will begin the true life! All this will be my
      home&mdash;mine! mine! and before anybody is up in the morning I will be
      down where that river of black water runs, and fish in the deep pools for
      trout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some one touched his elbow. He turned with a quick nod and smile to greet
      Dicky Westland. &ldquo;I am up ages before you, you see,&rdquo; he said genially. &ldquo;It
      was barely daylight when I woke&mdash;and I suffered tortures trying to
      remain in bed even till six. Oh, this is wonderful out here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully jolly place, all round,&rdquo; commented Dicky. He blinked to exorcise
      the spirit of sleep and gazed at the prospect with determined enthusiasm.
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t looked about much, but I&rsquo;ve found out one thing already.
      There&rsquo;s a ghost in my room&mdash;and I think he must have been a
      professional pedestrian in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; cried Christian, gaily. &ldquo;Have you had coffee&mdash;or it is
      tea you people drink, isn&rsquo;t it? Then shall we get to work? I want the
      papers out of the way before Emanuel comes. They will all be here between
      nine and ten. I wanted to send carriages to Craven Arms, but it seemed
      there were not horses enough, so hired traps are to be brought up from the
      station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know who are coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Julius, and Emanuel and his wife; the captain and his wife and
      brother; Lord Chobham, and Lord Lingfield&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if any of
      their women will come&mdash;and Lady Cressage. Then there are some
      solicitors, and perhaps some old acquaintances of my grandfather&rsquo;s. At all
      events, Welldon has ordered four carriages and a break. There is to be
      breakfast at ten, and I shall be glad when it is all over&mdash;when
      everything is over. Do you know?&mdash;I have never been to a funeral in
      my life&mdash;and I rather funk it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re not so bad as you always think they&rsquo;re going to be,&rdquo; said the
      secretary, consolingly. &ldquo;The main thing is the gloves. I never could
      understand it&mdash;but black gloves are invariably about two sizes
      smaller than ordinary colors. You want to look out for that. But I dare
      say your man is up to the trick&mdash;he looks a knowing party, does
      Falkner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy I shall give him back to Emanuel,&rdquo; remarked Christian,
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an excellent servant, but he reminds me too much of Duke Street.
      Did you notice the old butler yesterday afternoon?&mdash;he stood at the
      head of the steps to meet us&mdash;that is old Barlow. I have a great
      affection for him. I shall have him valet me, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he rather venerable for the job?&rdquo; suggested the other. &ldquo;And
      wouldn&rsquo;t it be rather a come-down for a head butler? They&rsquo;re awfully keen
      about their distinctions among themselves, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian smiled with placidity. &ldquo;I think that the man whom I pick out to
      be nearest me will feel that he has the best place in the household. I
      shall be very much surprised indeed if that isn&rsquo;t Barlow&rsquo;s view. And of
      course he will have his subordinates. But now let us take Welldon&rsquo;s
      statement for the last half of &rsquo;95, and the two halves of &rsquo;96.
      Then we can get to the mine. Unless I am greatly mistaken, that is most
      important. I find that the mining company&rsquo;s lease falls in early next
      year. And won&rsquo;t you ring the bell and have Welldon sent up when he comes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon mature reflection Christian decided not to descend to meet his guests
      at breakfast. When he had dismissed the estate agent, Welldon, after a
      prolonged and very comprehensive interview, he announced this decision to
      Westland. &ldquo;You must go down and receive them in my place,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say that you have a cold,&rdquo; suggested Dicky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; returned Christian, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary to enter into details. You receive them&mdash;that is
      all. I have spoken with Barlow; he knows what to do with them in the
      matter of rooms and so on. I am breakfasting here. And afterward&mdash;say
      at eleven o&rsquo;clock&mdash;I will see some of them here. There is an hour to
      spare then, before we go to the church. I am not clear about this&mdash;which
      ones to see first. There is that stupid reading of the will after we get
      back&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George! do they do that still?&rdquo; interrupted Dicky. &ldquo;I know they did in
      Trollope and George Eliot&mdash;but I thought it had gone out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is kept up in old families,&rdquo; replied Christian, simply. &ldquo;In this case
      it is a pure formality, of course. There is no mystery whatever. The will
      was made in 1859, after the entail was broken, and merely bequeaths
      everything in general terms to the heir-at-law. My grandfather covenanted,
      at the same time, to Lord Julius to make no subsequent will save by his
      advice and consent&mdash;so that there can be no complications of any
      kind. I am thinking whether it would be better to see Lord Julius and
      Emanuel before the reading of this will or after. Really it makes no
      difference&mdash;perhaps it is better to get it over with. Yes&mdash;say
      to them that I beg they will come to me here at eleven. You might bring
      them up and then leave us together&mdash;or no, they know the way. Let
      them come up by themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the open window there came the grinding sound of wheels upon the
      gravel of the drive, around at the east front. At a gesture from the
      other, Dicky hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself, Christian wandered again to the casement, and regarded
      the spacious view with renewed interest. Falkner entered presently,
      bearing a large tray, and spread some covered dishes upon a cloth on the
      library table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many carriages have come?&rdquo; the master asked from his place at the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four, Your Grace&mdash;and a break with some wreaths and Lord Chobham&rsquo;s
      man and a maid&mdash;I think it is Lady Cressage&rsquo;s maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has come&mdash;outside the family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three gentlemen, Your Grace&mdash;one of them is Mr. Soman. Barlow thinks
      they are all solicitors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian mused briefly upon the presence of Lord Julius&rsquo;s man of
      business. Since that first evening of his on English soil, at Brighton, he
      had not seen this Mr. Soman. He remembered nothing of him, indeed, save
      his green eyes. And now that he thought of it, even this was not a
      personal recollection. It was the remark of the girl on the boat, about
      his having green eyes, which stuck in his memory. He smiled, as he looked
      idly out on the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl on the boat! Was it not strange that his mind should have applied
      to her this distant and chilling designation? Only a few days ago&mdash;it
      would not be a week till to-morrow&mdash;she had seemed to him the most
      important person in the world. A vision of his future had possessed him,
      in which she alone had a definite share. How remote it seemed&mdash;and
      how curious!
    </p>
    <p>
      He recalled, quite impersonally, what he had heard in one way or another
      about her family. Her father was some sort of underling in the general
      post office&mdash;a clerk or accountant, or something of the kind. There
      was a son&mdash;of course, that would be the brother Cora had spoken of&mdash;and
      the ambition of the family had expended itself in sending this boy to a
      public school, and to the university. The family had made great sacrifices
      to do this&mdash;and apparently these had been wasted. He had the distinct
      impression of having been told that the son was a worthless fellow. How
      often that occurred in England&mdash;that everything was done for the son,
      and nothing at all for the daughters! Then in fairness he reflected that
      it was even worse in France. Yes, but somehow Frenchwomen had a talent for
      doing for themselves. They were cleverer than their brothers&mdash;more
      helpful, resourceful&mdash;in spite of the fact that the brothers had
      monopolized the advantages. Images of capable, managing Frenchwomen he had
      known rose before his mind&rsquo;s eye; he saw them again accomplishing wonders
      of work, diligent, wise, sensible, understanding everything that was said
      or done. Yet, oddly enough, these very paragons of feminine capacity had a
      fatal unfeminine defect; they did not know how to bring up their sons.
      Upon that side they were incredibly weak and silly; it was impossible to
      prevent their making pampered fools of their boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his vagrant fancies were concentrated upon the question of how
      Frances Bailey would bring up a boy&mdash;a son of her own. It was an
      absurd query to have raised itself in his mind&mdash;and he put it away
      from him with promptitude. There remained, however, a kind of mental
      protest lodged on her behalf among his thoughts. He perceived that in his
      ruminations he had done her an injustice. She was not inferior in
      capability or courage to any of the self-sufficient Frenchwomen he had
      been thinking of, and in the matter of intellectual attainments was she
      not immeasurably superior to them all? The translucent calm of her mind&mdash;penetrating,
      far-reaching, equable as the starlight&mdash;how queer that it should be
      coupled with such a bad temper! She always quarreled with him, and bullied
      him, when they were together. Even when she was exhibiting to him the
      sunniest aspects of her mood, there was always a latent defiance of him
      underneath, ready to spring forth at a word. He remembered how, at the
      close of their first meeting, she had refused to tell him her name. He saw
      now that this obstinacy of hers had annoyed him more than he had imagined.
      For an instant it assumed almost the character of a grievance&mdash;but
      then his attention fastened itself at random upon the remarkable fact that
      he had seen her only twice in his life. Upon reflection, this did seem
      very strange indeed. But it was the fact&mdash;and in the process of
      readjusting his impressions of the past six months to fit with it, the
      figure of her receded in his mind, grew less as she moved away under a
      canopy of dull yellowish-green, which vaguely identified itself with the
      trees on the Embankment. She dwindled thus till he thought of her again,
      with a dim impulse of insistence upon the phrase, as the girl on the boat.
      The transition to thoughts of other things gave his mind no sort of
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered some of these other things&mdash;formlessly and
      light-heartedly&mdash;while he stood at the library table, and picked
      morsels here and there from the dishes laid for him. His absence of
      appetite he referred tacitly to the warmth of the day, as it was sunnily
      developing itself outside. Here on this shaded side of the castle, it was
      cool enough, but there was the languor of spring in the air. He
      scrutinized this new library of his afresh. Until Barlow had opened it for
      him, shortly after his arrival yesterday, it could not have been used for
      years. Most of its appointments had a very ancient look; no doubt they
      must date back at least to the seventh Duke&rsquo;s time. It was incredible that
      his grandfather, the eighth Duke, should have been inspired to furnish a
      library. There were many shelves of apparently very old books as well, but
      there was also a vast deal of later rubbish&mdash;stock and sporting
      annuals, veterinary treatises, county directories and the like&mdash;which
      he would lose no time in putting out. He saw already how delightful a room
      could be made of it. It had the crowning merit of being connected with the
      suite of apartments he had chosen for his own. From the door at the side,
      opposite the fine old fireplace, one entered the antechamber to his
      dressing-room. This gave to the library an intimate character, upon which
      he reflected with pleasure. Here he would come, secure from interruption,
      and spend among his books the choicest and most fruitful hours of his
      leisure. It was plain to him that henceforth he would do a great deal of
      reading, and perhaps&mdash;why not?&mdash;of writing too.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rap upon the door, and then Falkner, opening it, announced
      Lord Julius and his son. They came in together, diffusing an impalpable
      effect of constraint. The elder man seemed in Christian&rsquo;s eyes bigger than
      ever; his white beard spread over the broad chest like a vine run wild.
      Emanuel, who lapsed in the wake of his father, was unexpectedly small by
      comparison. The shadows, where the two stood, emphasized the angular
      peculiarities of his bald head. His thin face took an effect of sallow
      pallor from his black clothes. Already he had his black gloves in his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian stepped forward to meet them&mdash;and was suddenly conscious of
      the necessity for an apology. &ldquo;I did not come down,&rdquo; he murmured, as he
      shook hands with a grave smile&mdash;&ldquo;I am not quite master of myself yet.
      It is still strange to me. But come to the window, and let us sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They followed him, and took the chairs he pushed out for them. He perched
      himself on the corner of the big table, and lightly stroked the glazed
      boot of the foot which was not on the floor. &ldquo;I am glad to hear that
      Kathleen has come,&rdquo; he said to his cousin. &ldquo;I hope she is very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extremely so,&rdquo; replied Emanuel. Then, upon reflection, he added, &ldquo;We had
      hoped that you would come to us, on your way down from London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was so much to do in town,&rdquo; explained Christian, hazily. &ldquo;My
      grandfather&rsquo;s lawyers came up at once from Shrewsbury, and it was
      necessary to see a good deal of them&mdash;and then there were the tailors
      and outfitters. It was all I could do to get away yesterday morning. And
      of course&mdash;by that time I was needed here.&rdquo; He turned to the other.
      &ldquo;And you are very well, Uncle Julius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well,&rdquo; said the elder man, with what Christian suspected for the
      instant to be significant brevity. The father and son had exchanged a
      look, as well, which seemed to have a meaning beyond his comprehension.
      But then he forgot these momentary doubts in the interest of the discovery
      that there were tears in his great-uncle&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Julius unaffectedly got out a handkerchief, and wiped them away. He
      looked up at the young man as through a mist. &ldquo;I never dreamed that I
      should feel it so much,&rdquo; he said, huskily. &ldquo;I am amazed at myself&mdash;and
      then ashamed at my amazement&mdash;but Kit&rsquo;s death has somehow put me
      about and upset me to a tremendous extent. There was thirteen years
      between us&mdash;but when you get to be an old man, that seems no more
      than as many weeks. And Emanuel&rdquo;&mdash;he addressed his son with the
      solemnity befitting a revelation&mdash;&ldquo;I am an old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel frowned a little in his abstracted fashion. &ldquo;You are less old than
      any other man of your years in England,&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian, listening, somehow found no conviction in these reassuring
      words. It dawned upon him suddenly that Lord Julius had in truth aged a
      great deal. The perception of this disarranged the speech he had in his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a thousand things to be talked over,&rdquo; he began, with an eye
      upon Emanuel, &ldquo;but I do not know if this is quite the opportune time. I
      wished to lose no time in seeing you both, of course&mdash;but you will
      not be hurrying away. No doubt there will be a better opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it will be found that there is so very much to say,&rdquo;
       remarked Emanuel. A gentle but persistent melancholy seemed to pervade his
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the complication&rdquo;&mdash;Christian began again, and hesitated.
      &ldquo;That is to say&mdash;you know even better and more fully than I do, to
      what a great extent I am in your hands. And there the complication, as I
      said, arises. I have been working very hard on the figures&mdash;with the
      lawyers in London, and here since I arrived&mdash;but before we touch
      those at all, I ought to tell you frankly, Emanuel: I do not see my way to
      meeting the conditions which you suggested to me last autumn, when we met
      first.&rdquo; Emanuel seemed in no wise perturbed by the announcement. His
      nervous face maintained its unmoved gravity. &ldquo;It was never anything more
      than a pious hope that you would,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;I may add,&rdquo; he went on,
      &ldquo;that even this hope cannot be said to have survived your first visit.
      Otherwise, I should have tried to have you see London under different
      auspices&mdash;through different eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The calmness with which the decision he had regarded as so momentous met
      acceptance disconcerted Christian. He had mentally prepared for the
      defense of his hostile attitude toward the System&mdash;and, lo! not a
      syllable of challenge was forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there remains, all the same, the principal difficulty,&rdquo; he said,
      thinking hard upon his words. &ldquo;It does not lessen my obligations to you as
      my chief creditors.&rdquo; He looked from one to the other, as if in uncertainty
      as to which was the master mind. &ldquo;You have both been very open with me.
      You have told me why it was that you devoted a large fortune to buying up
      the mortgages on the estate which is now mine&mdash;and to lending always
      more money upon it&mdash;until now the interest eats up the income like a
      visitation of locusts. But my knowledge of the motives does not help me.
      And you must not think, either,&rdquo; his confidence was returning now, and
      with it a better control over his phrases&mdash;&ldquo;that I am begging for
      help. I look the situation in the face, and I do not feel that I am afraid
      of it. I see already many ways in which I can make a better fight of it
      than my grandfather made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Julius held up a hand. &ldquo;Is there not a misconception there?&rdquo; he
      asked, pleasantly enough. &ldquo;A fight involves antagonists&mdash;and I
      intervened in poor Kit&rsquo;s affairs as a protector, not as an assailant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian stood erect, and knitted his brows in puzzled thought upon both
      the manner and the matter of these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is still the same,&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;You were his good friend&mdash;as
      I know you are mine&mdash;or hope very sincerely that you are&mdash;but
      none the less you were his overwhelmingly big creditor, as now you are
      mine. If one is greatly in debt, then one struggles to get out. It is in
      that sense that I meant the word &lsquo;fight.&rsquo; And, to repeat, I see many ways
      of making progress. I find that Welldon is not exclusively my man. He is
      the agent of three other estates as well, because we could not pay him
      enough here for all of his services. That I will alter at once. I find
      that we have no mineral bailiff. The company at Coalbrook has paid such
      royalties as it pleased, without check of any sort. We have the right to
      examine their books, but it has never been exercised. Next week my
      secretary and Welldon go to Coalbrook. I find that the company&rsquo;s lease of
      twenty-one years expires next February. Eh bien! It will be strange if I
      do not get ten thousand pounds hereafter, where less than four has come in
      hitherto. My lawyers already know of capitalists who desire to bid for the
      new lease&mdash;and the estimate of increase is theirs, not mine. But
      these are details. I mention them to you only to show you that I am not
      afraid. But anxious, I do not deny that I am. I have not been bred to
      these things&mdash;and I may easily make mistakes. It would take a great
      load off my mind if&mdash;if, in some measure, you would be my advisers as
      well as my creditors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you ever have doubted that?&rdquo; asked Emanuel, in a tone of
      somber kindliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but I do not mean advice about the management of the estate,&rdquo; put in
      Christian, with an over-eager instinct of self-defense. &ldquo;I do not shrink
      from taking that completely on my own shoulders. I would not trouble you
      with anything of that sort. But of larger matters&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one large matter,&rdquo; interrupted Lord Julius, speaking with great
      deliberation, &ldquo;which I find outweighing all others in my mind. It is not
      new to my mind&mdash;but to-day it pushes everything else aside. It is the
      thought of the family itself. I have told you this before&mdash;let me say
      it to you again. Everything that I have done&mdash;every penny that I have
      laid out&mdash;has been with this one end in view&mdash;the family. Yet
      this morning I have been thinking of it&mdash;and I am frightened. While
      poor old Kit lingered along, it was not so easy to grasp it, somehow&mdash;but
      his going off makes it glaring. There are too few of us. I am alone in my
      generation&mdash;and so is Emanuel in his&mdash;and so are you in yours,
      save for those rowdy simpletons Eddy and Gus. And beyond you, there is
      only that little girl baby of Cora Bayard&rsquo;s! I want you to marry,
      Christian. I want to see sons of yours growing up here at Caermere&mdash;hearty,
      fine boys to carry the name of Torr along. That I am really in earnest
      about. By comparison with it, nothing else on earth matters&mdash;for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I shall marry,&rdquo; Christian replied, in smiling seriousness. &ldquo;Of
      course, that is the obvious thing to be done. And now&rdquo;&mdash;he looked at
      his watch&mdash;&ldquo;it is time for me to dress. It is arranged that you and
      Emanuel and Kathleen drive to the church in the carriage with me. It is
      not quite orthodox precedence, I know, but I could not bear to&mdash;to
      have it otherwise. And we will think no more about those other matters
      until tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other matters,&rdquo; repeated Lord Julius, and exchanged a look with his son
      as they rose. &ldquo;My dear Christian, there are no other matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not till to-morrow,&rdquo; answered Christian, with a doubtful smile.
      &ldquo;But then I am afraid there are a good many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel filled in the pause. &ldquo;Mr. Soman has brought all the papers,&rdquo; he
      said, with a flitting return to his lighter manner. &ldquo;It is my father&rsquo;s
      meaning that the mortgages are extinguished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian gazed from one to the other with a face full of stupefaction.
      His knees shook and sought to bend under him. Tremblingly he essayed to
      speak&mdash;and his lips would make no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Julius laid his big hand on the young man&rsquo;s shoulder&mdash;and
      Christian, dimly recalling the effect of this touch in the days when he
      had first known it, thrilled at the novel restfulness it somehow now
      conferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only show me a son of yours,&rdquo; said the old man, with tender gravity. &ldquo;Let
      me see an heir before I die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without further words, the two left him. Christian, staring at the
      shadowed door through which they had vanished, remained standing. His
      confused brain quailed in the presence of thoughts more stupendous than
      the ancient hills outside.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>everal thousand
      people caught that day their first curious glimpse of the new master of
      Caermere. At the most there were but a handful of aged persons, in the
      throng clustered along the sides of the road winding down from the Castle
      to the partially restored medieval collegiate church in the valley, who
      could remember any other duke than the one being borne now to lie among
      his fathers. The fact that these venerable folk, without exception, were
      in the enjoyment of a day&rsquo;s holiday from the workhouse, might have
      interested a philosopher, had it been pressed upon his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite two hundred horsemen, mounted in their own saddles on their own
      beasts, rode in the long procession which descended from Caermere toward
      the close of the noon hour. Clad in decent black for the greater part,
      with old silk hats or other formal and somber headgear, they jogged
      sedately in unison as the curbed horses stepped with caution down the
      hill. Their browned and large-featured faces wore a uniform mask of
      solemnity&mdash;distinguished chiefly by a resolute contraction of brows
      and lips, and eyes triumphantly cleared of all traces of speculation. They
      looked down, as they passed, upon the humbler dalesmen and laborers of the
      hillsides, and their womenfolk and swarming children, with an impassive,
      opacated gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the green, before the little covered gateway to the churchyard, dull
      murmurs spread through this cortege, propelled sidelong from mouths which
      scorned to open; the main principles of a proposed evolution came slowly,
      in some mysterious way, to be comprehended among them: after almost less
      backing and pushing into one another than might have been expected, they
      perceived themselves emerging into an orderly arrangement, by which they
      lined the two sides of the carriage-way crossing the green. They regarded
      each other across this significant strip of gravel with a gloomy stolidity
      of pride: the West Salop Yeomanry could scarcely have done it better. Then
      another rustle of whispered sounds along their ranks toward the church&mdash;and
      the civic side of their demonstration came uppermost. With a tightened
      left hand upon the reins, they removed their hats, and held them so that
      they could most readily read the names of the makers inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriages bearing the family of Torr, preceded by the curtained
      hearse, and followed by a considerable number of broughams and closed
      landaus recognizable as the property of the neighboring gentry, moved
      silently forward along this lane of uncovered horsemen. The distant
      swelling moan of the organ floated on the May air, in effect a comment
      upon the fact that the tolling of the bell in the tower had ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intermittent noise of carriage-doors being sharply shut, and of wheels
      getting out of the way, proceeded from the head of the procession at the
      gate&mdash;and tenants and other undistinguished people on foot began to
      press forward between the ranks. The horsemen, with furtive glances to
      right and left, put on their hats again, and let the restive animals
      stretch their muscles in the path. A few, dismounting, and giving their
      bridles over to boys, joined those who were moving toward the church. The
      majority, drawing their horses aside into groups formed at random, and
      incessantly shifting, lent their intellects, and in some restrained
      measure their tongues, to communion upon the one great problem of the day:&mdash;would
      the new Duke set the Hunt on its legs again?
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was so intimately connected with their tenderest emotions and
      convictions, that no one liked to speak of it thoughtlessly or upon hasty
      impulse. Even those who doubted most, shrank from hearing the prophecies
      of evil they felt prone to utter. Men who nourished almost buoyant hopes
      still hesitated to create a confidence which must be so precarious. While
      the faint sustained recitative of the priest in the church could be heard,
      insistent and disturbing like the monotone of a distant insect, and then
      the sounds of the organ once more, and of singing, fell upon the sunlit
      green, the horsemen spoke cautiously about the hounds. Even before Lord
      Porlock&rsquo;s death, things had not been what they should have been. The pack
      was even then, as one might say, falling between two stools. The Torrs
      hadn&rsquo;t the money to keep the thing up properly themselves, but they showed
      their teeth savagely the minute mention was made of getting in some
      outside help. But since Porlock&rsquo;s death&mdash;well, the condition of
      affairs had been too painful for words. The horsemen shook their heads in
      dumb eloquence upon this tragic interval. The Kennels had lapsed into a
      state hardly to be thought of, much less discussed. There had been no
      puppy-walk. Were there any young dogs at all? And, just heavens! if there
      were, what must they be like!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet the country-side, outraged as it felt itself to be in its finest
      feelings, beheld itself helpless. The old Duke&mdash;but really this was
      not just the time and place for saying what they felt about the old Duke
      They glanced uneasily toward the church when this theme suggested itself,
      and nodded with meaning to one another. It could be taken for granted that
      there were no illusions among them concerning <i>him</i>. But what about
      the new man? Eyes brightened, lips quivered in beseeching inquiry, at the
      mention of this omnipotent stranger. What was he like? Had anybody heard
      anything that Welldon had said about him? It seemed that he was French
      bred, and that, considered by itself, might easily involve the worst. But
      then, was there not a story that he had ridden to the hounds in
      Derbyshire? Perhaps the younger generation of Frenchmen were better
      fellows than their fathers&mdash;but then, there was the reported fact
      that the Duke of Orleans fell off his horse and broke his leg whenever he
      tried to ride. Sir George had been informed in Paris that he would have
      been King of France by this time if he had been able to stick in a saddle.
      Yet, when one thought of it, did not this very fact indicate a fine new
      public sentiment in France, on the subject of horsemanship&mdash;and
      perhaps even of sport in general?
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian, at the door of the church, had thought most of clenching his
      teeth, and straining his upper-arms against his sides, to keep from
      trembling. He had not pictured himself, beforehand, as entering this
      burial place of his ancestors alone. Yet, in the churchyard, that was how
      the matter arranged itself. His first idea had been to lead, with Kathleen
      on his arm&mdash;but she had said her place was with Emanuel instead. Then
      the alternative of walking arm-in-arm with Lord Julius had seemed to him
      even more appropriate&mdash;but this too, in the confused constraint of
      the moment, had gone wrong. Stealing an anxious half-glance over his
      shoulder, he discovered that Lord Julius had placed himself at Kathleen&rsquo;s
      other side. The slight gesture of appealing invitation which he ventured
      upon did not catch the old man&rsquo;s eye. There was nothing for it but to
      stand alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be the strange, unsupported central figure in such a pageant unnerved
      him. He stood tremulously behind the pall&mdash;a burden draped with a
      great purple embroidered cloth, and borne upon the shoulders of eight
      peasant-laborers from the estate&mdash;and noted fleetingly that, so
      stunted and mean of stature were these poor hinds, he looked with ease
      above them, over their load, into the faces of the two priests advancing
      down the walk toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      These persons, an elderly, dark man, with a red hood folded upon his
      shoulders, and a thin-faced fair young man, seemed to return the gaze with
      meaning. He caught himself feeling that their eyes deferred to him; yes,
      if they had bowed to the ground, the effect of their abasement before him
      could not have been more palpable. Looking perfunctorily across the chasm
      of death, their glances sought to, make interest with the living. He hated
      them both on the instant. As they wheeled, and by their measured steps
      forward drew slowly in their wake the bearers of the pall, the chant of
      the elder&mdash;&ldquo;I am the Resurrection and the Life&rdquo;&mdash;came vaguely to
      his ears, and found them hostile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the old church&mdash;dim, cool, cloistral&mdash;was larger
      than Christian had assumed from its outer aspect. Many people were
      present, crowded close in the pews nearest the door&mdash;and strangely
      enough, it was his perception that these were chiefly women, of some
      unlabeled class which at least was not his own, that brought to him of a
      sudden self-command. He followed the bier up the aisle to its
      resting-place before the rail, took tacit cognizance of the place
      indicated to him by some man in professional black, and stood aside to let
      Kathleen pass in before him, all with a restored equanimity in which he
      was himself much interested. Through the reading of the Psalm and the
      Epistle he gave but the most vagrant attention to their words. The priests
      read badly, for one thing; the whining artificiality of their elocution
      annoyed and repelled him. But still more, his thoughts were diverted by
      the suggestiveness of everything about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Especially, the size of the funeral gathering, and of the mounted and
      wheeled procession, had impressed him. There need be no pretense that
      affection or esteem for the dead man had brought out, from the sparsely
      populated country round about, this great multitude. Precisely for that
      reason, it became a majestic fact. The burial of a Duke of Glastonbury had
      nothing to do with, personal qualities or reputation. It was like the
      passing away of a monarch. People who cared nothing for the individual
      were stirred and appealed to by the vicissitudes of an institution. Inset
      upon the walls around him were marble tablets, and more archaic canopies
      of stone over little carved effigies of kneeling figures; beyond, at the
      sides of the chancel, he could see the dark, rectangular elevations of the
      tombs, capped by recumbent mail-clad statues, with here and there a gleam
      of gilt or scarlet retained from their ancient ornamentation; even as he
      had walked slowly up the aisle, his downcast eyes had noticed the chiseled
      heraldry of stones beneath his feet. Everywhere about him was the historic
      impact of the Torrs. Their ashes were here&mdash;their banners and shields
      and tilting-helmets, their symbolical quarterings of the best arms of the
      West, their own proudest device of all. Their white bull on the green
      ground was familiar in England long before the broom-corn of the Angevins
      had been thought of. The clerkly pun on Tor and Taurus was as like as not
      older than the English language itself. All this made something mightier,
      more imposing and enduring, than any edifice to be reared by man alone. It
      was only in part human, this structure of the family. The everlasting
      hills were a part of it, the dark ranges of forests, the spirits and
      legends of the ancient Marches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>In the morning it is green, and groweth up; but in the evening it is
      cut down, dried up and withered,</i>&rdquo; droned the young clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if man seemed to count for but little in this tremendous, forceful
      aggregation of tradition and custom, yet again he might be all in all. The
      tall old man under the purple pall, there&mdash;it was easy to think
      contemptuously of him. Christian recalled, in a kind of affrighted musing,
      that one view of his grandfather that he had had. The disgust with which
      he had heard the stupid, violent words from those aged lips revived within
      him&mdash;then changed to wonder. Was it not, after all, the principle of
      strength which most affected men&rsquo;s minds? There had been discernible in
      that grandfather of his a certain sort of strength&mdash;dull,
      unintelligent, sinister, half-barbarous, but still strength. Was it not
      that which had brought forth the two hundred horsemen? And if this one
      element, of strength&mdash;yes, you might call it brute strength&mdash;were
      lacking, then would all the other fine qualities in the world avail to
      hold the impalpable, intangible combination together?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>He shall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
       It was the old parson who was reading now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>For He must reign, till He hath put all enemies under His feet</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, even in this Protestant religion to which he had passively become
      committed, force was the real ideal! Christian&rsquo;s wandering mind fastened
      itself for a moment upon the ensuing words of the lesson, but got nothing
      from their confusing reiterations. He lapsed into reverie again, then
      started abruptly with the sudden perception that everybody in the church
      behind him must be looking at him. In the pew immediately behind, there
      would be Captain Edward and his wife, and Augustine; in the one behind
      that Lady Cressage, Lord Chobham and his son; beyond them scores and
      scores of others seated in rows, and then a throng in the aisle and the
      doorway&mdash;all purporting to think of the dead, but fixing their eyes
      none the less on the living. And it was not alone in the church, but
      through the neighborhood, for miles round about: when men spoke of the old
      Duke who was gone, their minds would in truth be dwelling upon the new
      Duke who was come. A thrill ran through his veins as the words spelled
      themselves out before his inner vision. The new Duke! He seemed never to
      have comprehended what it meant before.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; and till this moment no genuine realization had come to him of this
      added meaning&mdash;this towering superstructure which the message of
      Julius and Emanuel had reared. It was only now that he hit upon the proper
      mental focus with which to contemplate this amazing thing. Not only was he
      a territorial ruler, one of the great nobles of Europe, but he was the
      master of wealth almost beyond counting as well!
    </p>
    <p>
      Those nearest to him were rising now, and he, obeying imperative impulses
      within him, lifted himself proudly to his feet. While the air throbbed
      with deep-voiced organ notes, in the pause which here ensued, his gaze
      rested upon the pall before him. There was a sense of transfiguration in
      the spectacle. The purple mantle became imperial Tyrian to his eyes&mdash;and
      something which was almost tenderness, almost reverence, yearned within
      him toward that silent, incased figure hidden beneath it. The mystic,
      omnipotent tie of blood gripped his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a collected sidelong look he surveyed the profiles of Emanuel and
      Lord Julius to his left. Theirs were the lineaments of princes. As if he
      had eyes in the back of his head, he beheld Edward and Augustine, as fancy
      revealed them standing in the pew behind him. Tall, slim, athletic, fair&mdash;the
      figures his imagination made of them appealed to the new patriarchal
      spirit in his heart. Perhaps they were not wholly nice, these young men,
      but they also were princes, and they were of his race, and no one should
      persecute them, or despitefully use them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uncouth little bearers of the dead had come forward again, and taken
      up their burden. In a small lady-chapel, extending from the transept at
      the left, the interment was to take place, and thither Christian now
      followed the pall, leading the menfolk of his family and the male guests
      of position who attached themselves to the group. Thus some score of
      black-clad figures clustered round the oblong opening in the old stone
      floor, and Christian, standing at its head, glanced impassively over the
      undefined throng of spectators gathered at the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live, and is full
      of misery</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; proclaimed the younger priest, with a sudden outburst of
      high-pitched, nasal tones which pierced the unexpectant ear. &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>He
      cometh up and is cut down, like a flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow,
      and never continueth in one stay.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian, watching abstractedly the impersonal wedge of faces at the
      door, all at once caught his breath in a sharp spasm of bewildered
      amazement. The little book he had been holding fell from his hands,
      balanced on its edge for an instant and toppled over into the dark vault
      below. He seemed unconscious of the incident&mdash;but stared fixedly,
      with parted lips and astonished eyes, at the image of something he had
      seen outside of the chapel. The thing itself had apparently vanished. He
      perceived vaguely that people were looking at him&mdash;and with a
      determined effort regained control of his face and bearing. The puzzling
      thought that it might have been an illusion&mdash;that perhaps he had seen
      nothing at all&mdash;brought mingled confusion and solace to his mind. He
      put his hand to the open book which Lord Julius at his side held toward
      him, and pretended to look at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coffin, now bereft of its purple covering, had been lowered to its
      final place. One of the bearers, standing over the cavity, crumbled dry
      earth from his tanned and clumsy fingers, and it fell with a faint rattle
      upon some resonant, unseen surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrase, &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Our dear brother, here departed</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; stuck out with
      awkward obtrusiveness from among the words of the priest. &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Earth to
      earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo; the sing-song went on. Then
      they were repeating the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer together in a buzzing, fitful
      murmur. There were other prayers&mdash;and then Christian read in the
      faces of those about him that the ceremony was finished. Accepting the
      suggestion of Lord Julius&rsquo;s movement, he also bent over, and looked
      blankly down into the obscurity of the vault. But when he lifted his head
      again, it was to throw a more searching and strenuous glance than ever
      over the knot of people outside the door. And yes!&mdash;he had not been
      deceived. He distinctly saw the face again, and with lightning swiftness
      verified its features. Beyond a shadow of doubt it was Frances Bailey whom
      he beheld, mysteriously present in this most unlikely of places.
    </p>
    <p>
      He withdrew his eyes and did not look that way again. The question whether
      she knew that he had recognized her, occupied his mind to the exclusion of
      all else, as he returned at the head of his followers to the body of the
      church. It still possessed his thoughts when he had joined the family
      group of chief mourners, loosely collecting itself in the aisle before the
      front pews, in waiting for the summons to the carriages. To some one he
      ought to speak at once, and for the moment his eye rested speculatively
      upon Cora. He identified her confidently, not only by her husband&rsquo;s
      proximity, but by the fact that her mourning veil was much thicker and
      longer than any of the others. Some unshaped consideration, however,
      restrained him, and on a swift second thought he turned to Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to look,&rdquo; he whispered to her, inclining his head&mdash;&ldquo;on
      the other side of the church, just in a line between the second pillar and
      the white-bearded figure in the window&mdash;there is a tall young woman,
      with the gray and black hat. Do you see her? In a kind of way she belongs
      to us&mdash;she is Cora&rsquo;s sister, but I&rsquo;m afraid if Cora asked her, she
      would not come to the Castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;once you talked to me about her,&rdquo; Kathleen reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, will you do this for me?&rdquo; he continued, in an eager murmur. &ldquo;Go to
      her, and make sure that she promises to come up with the rest. It would be
      unforgivable&mdash;if we let her go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had an uneasy feeling that Mrs. Emanuel&rsquo;s veil did not prevent her
      shrewd glance from reading him through and through&mdash;but he did not
      seek to dissemble the breath of relief with which he heard her assent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was not a very
      easy task,&rdquo; Kathleen found opportunity to say to Christian, half an hour
      later, as the family were assembling in his library. They stood together
      by the window nearest the table, and watched the embarrassed deportment of
      Lord Lingfield under the conversational attentions of Cora, as they talked
      in low tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is here in the Castle: that is the principal thing.&rdquo; He did not
      shrink now from the implication of his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she finally consented to come,&rdquo; explained the other. &ldquo;I told her
      that you insisted upon it&mdash;and then&mdash;then I used some persuasion
      of my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Kathleen,&rdquo; he said, simply. &ldquo;It seems that she is to write
      an account of the funeral for some London newspaper. She said frankly,
      however, that that of itself did not account for her coming. It will pay
      her expenses&mdash;so she said&mdash;but the paper would not have sent her
      specially. And there is no doubt about it&mdash;she was really annoyed at
      being discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The solicitors from Shrewsbury, entering the room now, gave at once an
      official air to everything. The elder of them, with oppressive formality,
      drew a formidable parchment from a bag held by his junior, and bowed
      elaborately to Christian. Then, as if he had received some mandate to do
      so from His Grace, he untied the tape, and cleared his throat. Those who
      had been seated, rose to their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The will came to them unaltered from 1859&mdash;and contained, wrapped in
      a surprising deal of pompous verbiage, a solitary kernel of essential
      fact. No legatee was mentioned save an impersonal being called the
      heir-at-law. The absolutism of dynastic rule contemplated no distribution
      or division of power. This slender, dark-eyed young man, standing with
      head inclined and a nervous hand upon the table, had not come into being
      until long after that will was made, and for other long years thereafter
      his very existence had been unknown to the family at large. Yet, as the
      lawyer&rsquo;s reading ended, there he stood before their gaze, the unquestioned
      autocrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This may be the best time to say it.&rdquo; Christian straightened himself, and
      addressed his family for the first time, with a grave smile, and a voice
      which was behaving itself better than he feared it would. &ldquo;There are no
      minor bequests, owing to the circumstances under which the will was drawn,
      but I have taken it upon myself to supply such omissions, in this matter,
      as shall commend themselves to my consideration. Upon this subject we may
      speak among ourselves at our leisure, later on.&rdquo; With distinguished
      self-possession he looked at his watch. &ldquo;I think luncheon is at two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed here an unrehearsed, and seemingly unpremeditated, episode.
      Lord Julius advanced with impressive gravity across the little open space,
      and taking the hand which Christian impulsively extended to him, bent over
      it in a formal and courtly bow. When Emanuel, following his father, did
      the same, it was within the consciousness of all that they had become
      committed to a new ceremonial rite. Kathleen, coming behind her husband,
      gave her cheek to be kissed by the young chief of her adopted clan&mdash;and
      this action translated itself into a precedent as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward and Augustine, after the hesitation of an awkward instant, came
      forward together, and in their turn, with a flushed stiffness of
      deportment, made their salutation to the head of the house. To them,
      conjointly, Christian said something in a whisper. He kissed Cora upon
      each cheek, with a faint smile in his eyes at her preference for the
      foreign method. His remoter cousins, the Earl of Chobham and Lord
      Lingfield, passed before him, and he vaguely noted the reservation
      expressed in their lifeless palms and frigid half-bow. They seemed to wish
      to differentiate themselves from the others&mdash;to express to him the
      Pickwickian character of their homage. They were not Torrs; they did not
      salaam to him as their over-lord. They had a rival dynasty of their own,
      and their appearance here involved nothing but the seemly courtesy of
      distant relationship. He perceived in a dim way that this was what their
      manner was saying to him&mdash;but it scarcely diverted his attention. His
      glance and his thoughts passed over their heads, to fasten upon the
      remaining figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cressage, unlike the other two women, had retained the bonnet and
      heavy veil of mourning. The latter she held drawn aside with a
      black-gloved hand as she approached. It flashed suddenly across
      Christian&rsquo;s brain that the year of her mourning for her own dead was not
      over&mdash;yet in her own house she wore gay laces and light colors. But
      it was unkind to remember this&mdash;and senseless, too. He strove to
      revivify, instead, the great compassionate impulse which formerly she had
      stirred within him. A pallid shadow of it was all that he could conjure up&mdash;and
      in the chill of this shadow he touched her white temple with his lips, and
      she moved away. There lingered in his mind a curious, passive conflict of
      memories as to whether their eyes had met or not. Then this yielded place
      to the impression some detached organ of perception had formed for him,
      that in that somber setting of crape her face had looked too small for the
      rest of her figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the whole subject melted from his mind, he turned toward the two
      young men who, upon his whispered request, had remained in the library
      after the departure of the others. He looked at his watch, and beckoned
      them forward with a friendly wave of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray come and sit down,&rdquo; he said, with affability upon the surface of his
      tone. &ldquo;We have a quarter of an hour, and I felt that it could not be put
      to better use than in relieving your minds a little&mdash;or trying to do
      so. Let me begin by saying that I do not think I have met either of you
      before. In fact, now that I reflect, I am sure that we have not met
      before. I am glad to see you both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two brothers had drawn near, and settled uneasily into the very chairs
      which Lord Julius and Emanuel had occupied some hours before. Again
      Christian half seated himself upon the corner of the table, but this time
      he swung his leg lightly as he surveyed his guests. It flattered his
      prophetic judgment to note that Augustine seemed the first to apprehend
      the meaning of his words, but that Edward, upon pondering them, appeared
      the more impressed by their magnanimity. Between them, as they regarded
      him and each other doubtfully, the family likeness was more striking than
      ever. Christian remembered having heard somewhere that their father, Lord
      Edward, had been a dark man, as a Torr should be. Their flaxen hair and
      dull blue eyes must come from that unmentionable mother of theirs, who was
      living in indefinite obscurity&mdash;if she was living at all&mdash;upon
      the blackmail Julius paid her for not using the family name. The thought
      somehow put an added gentleness into his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you&mdash;Eddy?&rdquo; he asked, forcing himself into the use of
      the diminutive as a necessary part of the patriarchal rôle he had assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine-and-twenty in October,&rdquo; answered the Captain, poutingly. It seemed
      on the tip of his tongue to add something else, but he did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s two years and a month between us,&rdquo; remarked Augustine, with more
      buoyancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been out of the army for five years,&rdquo; pursued Christian. &ldquo;It
      seems that you became a Captain very early. Would there be any chance of
      your taking it up again, where you left off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edward shook his head. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be done twice. I got it by a lucky
      fluke&mdash;a friend of my father&rsquo;s, you know. But they&rsquo;re deuced stiff
      now,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You have to do exams and things. An old johnnie asks
      you what bounds Peru on the northeast, and if you can&rsquo;t remember just at
      the minute, why, you get chucked. Out you go, d&rsquo;ye see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your idea, then? What would you like to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Edward knitted his scanty, pale brows over this question, and
      regarded the prospect through the window in frowning perplexity. &ldquo;Oh,
      almost anything,&rdquo; he remarked at last, vacuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian permitted himself the comment of a smiling sniff. &ldquo;Think it
      over,&rdquo; he said, and directed his glance at the younger brother. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in
      Parliament,&rdquo; he observed, with a slight difference in tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure
      that I quite understand-What is it that attracts you in a&mdash;in a
      Parliamentary career?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Augustine lifted his pale, scanty brows in surprise. The right kind of
      answer did not come readily to him. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began with hesitation&mdash;&ldquo;there
      was that seat in Cheshire where we still had a good bit of land&mdash;and
      Julius didn&rsquo;t object&mdash;and I had an idea it would help me in the
      City.&rdquo; He recovered confidence as he went on. &ldquo;But it is pretty well
      played out now, I came in too late. The Kaffir boom spoiled the whole
      show. Five years ago an M P. could pick and choose; I knew fellows who
      were on twenty boards at a time, and big blocks of stock were flying about
      them like&mdash;like hailstones. But you can&rsquo;t do that now. M. P.s are as
      cheap as dirt; they won&rsquo;t have &rsquo;em at any price. A fellow hardly
      makes his cab-fares in the City nowadays. And even if you get the very
      best inside tips, brokers have got so fearfully nasty about your margins
      being covered&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; interposed Christian, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t necessary that we should go
      into all that. I do not like to hear about the City. If you get money for
      yourself there, you have taken it away from somebody else. I would rather
      that people of our name kept away from such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you come to that, everybody&rsquo;s money is taken from somebody else,&rdquo; said
      Edward, unexpectedly entering the conversation. His brother checked him
      with a monitory hand on his arm. &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Augustine
      warned him. &ldquo;I quite see what the Duke means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you see what I mean,&rdquo; returned Christian, quietly, &ldquo;perhaps you will
      follow the rest that I have to say; Do you care very much about remaining
      in Parliament?&rdquo; Augustine&rsquo;s face reflected an eager mental effort to get
      at his august interlocutor&rsquo;s meaning. &ldquo;Well&mdash;that&rsquo;s so hard to say,&rdquo;
       he began, anxiously. &ldquo;There are points about it, of course&mdash;but then&mdash;when
      you look at it in another way, why of course&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My idea is this,&rdquo; Christian interposed once more. &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t mind
      my saying it&mdash;but there seems to me something rather ridiculous about
      your being in the House. Parliament ought not to be treated as a joke, or
      a convenience. It is a place for men who will work hard in the service of
      the country, and who have the tastes and the information and the judgment
      and the patriotic devotion to make their work of value to their country. I
      dare say that there are members who do not entirely measure up to this
      standard, but after all there <i>is</i> a standard, and I do not like to
      be a party to lowering it. England has claims upon us Torrs; it deserves
      something better at our hands than that. So I think I would like you to
      consider the idea of resigning your seat&mdash;or at least, dropping out
      at the end of this Parliament. Or no&mdash;that would be waiting too long.
      You would better think of retiring now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that <i>I</i> am to stand for the seat, instead?&rdquo; asked
      Edward, looking up with awakened interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian stared, then sighed smilingly and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been in my mind,&rdquo; he replied with
      gentleness. He contemplated the elder brother afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you thought yet what you would like to do?&rdquo; he asked again, almost
      with geniality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye mean &lsquo;do&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquired Edward, with a mutinous note in his voice.
      &ldquo;Is it something about a business? If you ask me straight, I&rsquo;m not so
      fearfully keen about doin&rsquo; anything. No fellow wants to do things, if he
      can rub along without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian found himself repressing a gay chuckle with effort. He had not
      dreamed he should like this one of his kinsmen so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no; you shall not do things,&rdquo; he promised him, with a sparkling
      eye. &ldquo;That would be too bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Edward turned in his chair, and recrossed his legs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trifle
      awkward, all this, you know,&rdquo; he declared, with an impatient scowl. &ldquo;It
      doesn&rsquo;t suit me to be made game of. You&rsquo;ve got the whip hand, and you can
      give me things or not, as you like, and I&rsquo;ve got to be civil and take what
      you offer, because I can&rsquo;t help myself&mdash;but damn me if I like to be
      chaffed into the bargain! I wouldn&rsquo;t do it to you, d&rsquo;ye see, if it was the
      other way about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian&rsquo;s face lapsed into instant gravity. A fleeting speculation as to
      that problematical reversal of positions rose in his mind, but he put it
      away. &ldquo;Ah, you mustn&rsquo;t think that,&rdquo; he urged, with serious tones. &ldquo;No,
      Cousin Edward, this is what I want to say to you.&rdquo; And then, all unbidden,
      the things he really wished to say, yet which he had not thought of
      before, ranged themselves in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;You have been a soldier. You were a soldier
      when you were a very young man. Now, you had an uncle who was also a
      soldier when he was a mere youth&mdash;a very loyal and distinguished
      soldier, too. He died a soldier when he was in his fortieth year&mdash;far
      away from his family, from his wife and son, and much farther away still
      from the place and country of his birth. Once, in his youth, he was mixed
      up in an unpleasant and even disgraceful affair. How much to blame he
      personally was&mdash;that I do not know. It was very long ago&mdash;and he
      was so young a man&mdash;really I refuse to consider the question. I could
      insist to myself that he was innocent&mdash;if I felt that it mattered at
      all, one way or the other&mdash;and if I did not feel that by doing so,
      somehow he would not be then so real a figure to me as he is now. And he
      is very real to me; he has been so all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, with a momentary break in his voice, to blink the tears from
      his eyes. It was not ducal, but he put the back of his hand to his cheeks,
      and dried them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I show you how it affects me,&rdquo; he continued, simply. &ldquo;No matter what he
      did in some stupid hour in London, he was a brave soldier before that, and
      after that. He fought for many losing causes; he died fighting for one
      which was most hopeless of all. I am proud that I am his son. I am proud
      for you, that you are his nephew. And something has occurred to me that I
      think you will like to do&mdash;for me and for him. When I stood to-day
      over our vault&mdash;where we are all buried&mdash;it cut me to the heart
      to remember that one of us lies alone, a great way off&mdash;in a strange
      land by himself. I propose to you that you go to Spain for me&mdash;it is
      at Seo de Urgel, in the mountain country of the Catalans&mdash;and that
      you find his grave, and that you bring him back here to sleep with his
      people. He would not return in his lifetime&mdash;but I think he would be
      pleased with us for bringing him back now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edward had looked fixedly up at his cousin, then glanced away, then
      allowed his blank gaze to return, the while these words were being spoken.
      It was impossible to gather from his reddened, immobile face, now, any
      notion of their effect upon him. But after a moment&rsquo;s pause, he rose to
      his feet, squared his shoulders and put out his hand to Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right; I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he said, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men shook hands, with a sense of magnetic communion which could
      have amazed no one more than themselves. Then, under a recurring
      consciousness of embarrassed constraint, they turned away from each other,
      and Edward wandered off awkwardly toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;a moment more,&rdquo; called Christian, with a step in his cousin&rsquo;s
      direction. Then on second thoughts he added: &ldquo;Or shall we let that wait? I
      will see you again&mdash;some time to-day or to-morrow. Yes&mdash;leave me
      now for a minute with your brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the door had closed upon Edward, Christian turned slowly to
      Augustine, and, as he leaned once more against the table, regarded him
      with a ruminating scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am puzzled about you,&rdquo; he remarked, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustine returned the gaze with visible perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; pursued Christian, &ldquo;that it rather annoys me that you don&rsquo;t
      tell me to puzzle and be damned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other took the words with a grimace, and an unhappy little laugh. He,
      too, rose to his feet. &ldquo;I funked it,&rdquo; he said with rueful candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t funk things with me,&rdquo; Christian advised him, with a testiness
      of which, upon the instant, he was ashamed. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he continued,
      less brusquely, &ldquo;I could take it from your brother that he did not want to
      do things. That fits him: he is not the kind of man to apply himself in
      that way. But I have the feeling that you are different. There ought to be
      performance&mdash;capacity&mdash;of some sort in you, if I could only get
      to know what it is. You are only my age. Isn&rsquo;t there something that
      particularly appeals to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Augustine balanced himself meditatively upon his heels. &ldquo;You say you bar
      the City&rdquo;&mdash;he remarked with caution. &ldquo;Would you have any objection to
      Johannesburg? It&rsquo;s not what it was, by any means, but it&rsquo;s bound to pick
      up again. I might do myself very well there&mdash;with a proper start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are thinking always of money!&rdquo; broke in Christian, sharply once
      again. &ldquo;Suppose that there was no question of money&mdash;suppose, what
      shall I say? that you had twelve hundred a year, secure to you without any
      effort of your own&mdash;what would you do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This seemed very simple to Augustine. &ldquo;I would do whatever you wanted me
      to do,&rdquo; he replied, with fervor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian shrugged his shoulders, and dismissed him with a gesture. &ldquo;We
      will speak again about it,&rdquo; he said coldly, and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Descending the great staircase a few minutes later, Christian entered the
      door which Barlow had been waiting to open for him&mdash;and made his
      first public appearance as the dispenser of Caermere&rsquo;s hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests, after the old mid-day fashion of the place, were already for
      the most part gathered in the large dining-hall, and stood or sat in
      groups upon the side pierced by the tall windows. These guests did not
      dissemble the interest with which they from time to time directed glances
      across to the other side, where a long table, laid for luncheon, put in
      evidence a grateful profusion of cold joints and made-dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pleased rustle of expectancy greeted Christian&rsquo;s advent, but it seemed
      that this did not, for the moment at least, involve food and drink. He
      strolled over to the company, and, as he exchanged words here and there,
      kept an attentive eye busy in taking stock of its composition. There were
      some forty persons present, of whom three-fourths, apparently, were county
      people. A few casual presentations forced themselves upon him, but the
      names of the new acquaintances established no foothold in his memory. He
      smiled and murmured words which he hoped were seasonable&mdash;but all the
      while he was scanning the assemblage with a purpose of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he came to Kathleen, and was able to have a private word in her
      ear. &ldquo;I do not see her anywhere,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not prevail upon her to come in to lunch,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I
      imagine it is partly a question of clothes. But she is being looked out
      for. And afterward I will take charge of her again, if you like&mdash;though&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sentence remained unfinished, as she took the arm Christian offered
      her, at Barlow&rsquo;s eloquent approach.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>uring the progress
      of the luncheon, Christian found no opportunity for intimate conversation
      with Emanuel&rsquo;s wife. The elderly and ponderously verbose Lord Chobham sat
      upon her right; there was the thin-faced, exigeant wife of some clerical
      person in gaiters&mdash;a rural dean, was it not?&mdash;full of dogmatic
      commonplaces, on his left. The other people did not seem to talk so much.
      The scene down the table&mdash;with so much black cloth offset garishly
      against the white linen in the daylight&mdash;presented an effect of
      funereal sobriety, curiously combined with a spontaneous reaction of the
      natural man against this effect. The guests ate steadily, and with energy;
      Christian noted with interest how freely they also drank. For himself, he
      could not achieve an appetite, but thirst was in the air. He lifted his
      glass bravely to Lord Julius, whose massive bulk and beard confronted him
      at the other end of the table&mdash;and then to others whose glance from
      time to time caught his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he found the chance to murmur to Kathleen: &ldquo;When this is over, I hope
      you will manage it so that I may speak with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded slow assent, without looking at him. He, observing her profile,
      realized all at once that something was amiss with her. It came back to
      him now that a certain intensity of sadness had dwelt in the first glance
      they had exchanged that morning, upon meeting. At the time he had referred
      it to the general aspect of woe which people put on at funerals. He saw
      now that it was a grief personal to herself. And now that he thought of
      it, too, there had been much the same stricken look upon Emanuel&rsquo;s face.
      It was incredible that they should be thus devoured by grief at the fact
      of his grandfather&rsquo;s death. No one had liked that old man overmuch&mdash;but
      surely they least of all. The emotion of Lord Julius was more intelligible&mdash;and
      yet even this had a quality of broken dejection in it which seemed
      independent of Caermere&rsquo;s cause for mourning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disquieting conviction that these dearly beloved cousins of his&mdash;these
      ineffably tender and generous friends of his&mdash;were writhing under
      some trouble unknown to him, took more definite shape in his mind with
      each new glance that he stole at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the thought sprang up that they might be unhappy because such a huge
      sum of money had been given to him, but on the instant he hated himself
      for being capable of formulating such a monstrous idea. The wondering
      solicitude which all this raised within him possessed his thoughts for the
      rest of the meal. He was consumed with impatience to get away so that he
      might question Kathleen about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet when at last he found himself beside her, standing before an old
      portrait in one of the chain of big rooms through which the liberated
      company had dispersed itself, this was just the question for which it
      seemed that no occasion would offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began speaking to him at once. &ldquo;The young lady&mdash;Miss Bailey, I
      should say&mdash;has gone for a walk&mdash;so Falkner learns from some of
      the women. They have the impression that she is coming back&mdash;but I
      don&rsquo;t know that I feel quite so sure about it.&rdquo; Christian&rsquo;s face visibly
      lengthened. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very awkward,&rdquo; he said, with vague annoyance. &ldquo;They do
      not arrange things in a very talented fashion, these people of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what could they arrange?&rdquo; she argued. An indefinable listlessness in
      her tone struck him. &ldquo;It is a free country, you know, and this is the
      nineteenth century. They cannot bodily capture a young woman and keep her
      in the Castle against her will. As I told you, I had difficulty in
      persuading her to come at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, what did you say to her?&rdquo; he asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly tell you. She is not an ordinary person&mdash;and I know
      only that I tried not to say ordinary things to her. But what it was that
      I did say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off with an uncertain gesture, and a
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you saw that she was not ordinary!&rdquo; said Christian, admiringly. &ldquo;I
      should love dearly to hear what you really think of her&mdash;the
      impression that she makes upon you.&rdquo; Kathleen roused herself and turned to
      him. &ldquo;Do you truly mean it, Christian?&rdquo; she asked him, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you blame me?&rdquo; he rejoined, with uneasy indirection.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her lips together, and stared up at the picture with a
      troubled face. &ldquo;I know so little of her,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;You put too big
      a responsibility upon me. It is more than I am equal to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden gust of self-reproach, he perceived afresh the marks of
      suffering in her countenance, and recalled his anxiety. &ldquo;Take my arm,&rdquo; he
      said, softly, &ldquo;and let us go on into the next room. There is a terrace
      there, I think. Forgive me for troubling you,&rdquo; he added, as they moved
      forward. &ldquo;I ought to have seen that you are not well&mdash;that you have
      something on your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer him immediately. &ldquo;It is Emanuel who is not well.&rdquo; she
      said, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian uttered a formless little exclamation of grieved astonishment.
      &ldquo;Oh, it is nothing serious?&rdquo; he whispered imploringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head in a doubtful way. &ldquo;No, I think not&mdash;that is, not
      irrevocably. But he has worked too hard. He has broken down under the
      strain. We are going away for a long journey&mdash;to rest, and forget
      about the System.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent his head to look into her eyes&mdash;trusting his glance to say
      the things which his lips shrank from uttering. A window stood open, and
      they passed out upon a broad stone terrace, shaded and pleasant under a
      fresh breeze full of forest odors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;the System&rdquo;&mdash;he ventured to say, as they stood alone here,
      and she lifted her head to breathe in the revivifying air&mdash;&ldquo;I felt
      always that it was too much for one man. The load was too great. It would
      crush the most powerful man on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded reflective assent. &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I hated it,&rdquo; she
      confessed to him, in a murmur full of contrition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is going away now,&rdquo; urged Christian, hopefully. &ldquo;You will have him
      to yourself&mdash;free from care, seeing strange and beautiful new places&mdash;as
      long as you like. Ah, then soon enough that gaiety of yours will return to
      you. Why, it is such a shock to me to think of you as sad, depressed&mdash;you
      who are by nature so full of joy and high spirits. Ah, but be sure they
      will all return to you! I make no doubt whatever of that. And Emanuel, too&mdash;he
      will get rested and strong, and be happy as he never was before&mdash;the
      dear fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him in wan, affectionate fashion. &ldquo;All the courage has gone
      out of me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Will it be coming back again? God knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Christian began, with hearty confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him. &ldquo;What I am fearful of&mdash;it is not so much his
      health, strictly speaking&mdash;but the terrible unsettling blow that all
      this means to him. It is like the death of a beautiful only child to the
      fondest of fathers. It tears his heart to pieces. He loved his work so
      devotedly&mdash;it was so wholly a part of his life&mdash;and to have to
      give it up! He says he is reconciled. Poor man, he tried with all his
      strength to make himself believe that he is. I catch him forcing a smile
      on his face when he sees me looking at him&mdash;and that is the hardest
      of all for me to bear. But I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;&mdash;she drew a long breath, and
      gazed with a wistful brightening in her eyes at the placid hills and sky&mdash;&ldquo;it
      may work itself out for the best. As you say&mdash;when we get away alone
      together, ah, that is where love like ours will surely tell. I do wrong to
      harbor any doubts at all. When two people love each other as we do&mdash;ah,
      Christian, boy, there&rsquo;s nothing else in all the world to equal that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He inclined his head gravely, to mark his reverential sympathy with her
      mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but you know nothing of it at all,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a lad&mdash;and
      love is no more to be understood by instinct than any other great wisdom.
      Millions of people pass through life talking about love&mdash;and they
      would stare with surprise if you told them they never had had so much as a
      glimmer of the meaning of it. They use the name of love in all the matings
      of young couples&mdash;and there&rsquo;s hardly once in a thousand times that it
      isn&rsquo;t blasphemy to mention it. Do you know what most marriages are?
      Life-sentences! If you have means and intelligence, you make your prison
      tolerable; you can get used to it, and even grow dependent upon it&mdash;but
      it is a prison still. The best-behaved convict eyes his warder with a
      cruel thought somewhere at the back of his mind. Do you remember&mdash;when
      you left us the first time, I begged you to be in no haste to marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed again. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember it all,&rdquo; he said, soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to feel so strongly upon that subject,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;It
      seems to me more important than all others combined. It is the last thing
      in the world that should be decided upon an impulse, or a passing fancy&mdash;yet
      that is just what happens all about us. The books are greatly to blame for
      that. They talk as if only boys and girls knew what love meant. They
      flatter the young people, and turn their empty heads, with the notion that
      their idlest inclinations are very probably sacred emotions&mdash;which
      they may trust to burn brightly in a pure flame all their lives. The
      innocent simpletons rush to light this penny dip that is warranted to
      blaze eternally, and in a week or a month they are in utter darkness. We
      trembled lest you, coming so suddenly into a new life, should meet with
      that misfortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled faintly at her. &ldquo;You see, I have not,&rdquo; he commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him thoughtfully. &ldquo;It is impossible to make rules for others
      in these matters,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;but there is this thing to be said. True
      love must be built upon absolutely true friendship; there can be no other
      foundation for it You will often see two men who are fond of each other.
      They delight in being together. Very often you cannot imagine what is the
      tie between them&mdash;and they would not be able to tell you. They just
      like to be together&mdash;even though they may not speak for hours, and
      may be as different in temperament as chalk and cheese. That is the
      essence of friendship&mdash;and you cannot have love without it. The man
      and the woman must have the all-powerful sense of ideal companionship
      between them. They must be able to say with truth to themselves that the
      world will always be richer to them together than apart. There may be many
      other elements in love, but there can be no love at all without this
      element. But you wonder why I am saying all this to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a deprecatory gesture of the hands. &ldquo;I am always charmed when you
      talk to me. I have been remembering that dear home of yours, and how
      inexpressibly good you were to me. I prize that memory so fondly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled with an approach to her old gaiety of manner. &ldquo;You were like a
      son of our own to us. And so we think of you now&mdash;as if you were
      ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with what munificence you have treated me!&rdquo; he exclaimed, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not? For whom else would we be laying up our money? Oh, there was
      no difference of opinion about that. Months ago it was decided that when
      you came into Caermere you should come into everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feared that Emanuel would be angry&mdash;disappointed&mdash;at my not
      taking up his work&mdash;but truly I could not. It wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to
      explain to you&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;let us not go into reasons. He had no feeling about it whatever.
      How should he? It would have been as reasonable to be vexed because the
      lenses of his spectacles did not fit your eyes. And Emanuel is
      reasonableness itself. No&mdash;the experiment was quite personal to
      himself. Without him, it could not have gone on at all. It will not go on
      now, when he leaves it to others. We make some little pretense that it
      will&mdash;but we know in our hearts that it won&rsquo;t. And there was a fatal
      fault in it. To begin with, that would have killed it sooner or later, in
      any case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; he interposed, with sensitive intuition. &ldquo;There
      was no proper place in it for women. &lsquo;The very corner-stone of the System
      was the perpetual enslavement of women&rsquo;&mdash;or rather, I should say&rdquo;&mdash;he
      stumbled awkwardly as the sweeping form of the quotation revealed itself
      to him&mdash;&ldquo;I should say, it did not provide women with the
      opportunities which&mdash;which&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen also had her intuitions. &ldquo;May I ask?&mdash;it sounds as if you
      were repeating a remark&mdash;was it Miss Bailey who said that about the
      corner-stone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian bit his lip and flushed confusedly. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I think those
      were her words,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;But you must remember,&rdquo; he added, eager to
      minimize-the offense&mdash;&ldquo;it was in the course of a long discussion on
      the whole subject, and she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dear girl!&rdquo; said Kathleen, with a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but you would love her!&rdquo; he cried, excitedly perceiving the
      significance of her words. &ldquo;She has the noblest mind&mdash;calm and broad
      and serene&mdash;and so fine a nature&mdash;I know you would love her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen put a hand on his arm, with motherly directness. &ldquo;But do <i>you</i>
      love her?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his own considerable surprise he hesitated. &ldquo;I have that feeling of
      deep friendship that you described,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;The charm of being
      where she is is like nothing else to me. I cannot think that it would ever
      lose its force for me. I get the effect of drawing strength and breadth of
      thought and temper from her, when I am with her. I would rather spend my
      life with her for my companion than any other woman I have ever seen. That
      is what you mean, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly,&rdquo; she made enigmatic response. &ldquo;But&mdash;now you mustn&rsquo;t answer
      me if I ask what I&rsquo;ve no business to ask&mdash;but the suspicion came to
      me while you were speaking&mdash;I am right, am I not, in thinking that
      you have said all this to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted with palpable reluctance, &ldquo;and she would not listen to
      me. Only a few hours before I heard the news of my grandfather&rsquo;s death, I
      asked her to be my wife, and she refused. She seemed very resolute. And
      yet she has some of that same feeling of friendship for me. She said that
      she had always a deep interest in me. She had read books&mdash;very
      serious books&mdash;in order to be able to advise me, if the chance ever
      came. All that bespeaks friendship, surely! And her coming here, to look
      on and still not be seen&mdash;you said yourself that she was distressed
      at being discovered&mdash;is not that the act of warm friendship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen pondered her reply. She looked away at the nearest hills across
      the river for some moments, with her gaze riveted fixedly as if in an
      absorption of interest. Without moving her head, she spoke at last: &ldquo;You
      have a good deal to say about friendship. It is my fault&mdash;I
      introduced the word and insisted on it&mdash;but did you also lay such
      stress upon this &lsquo;friendship&rsquo; to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know her nature,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;There is nothing weak or
      commonplace in it. One does not talk to her as to an ordinary woman&mdash;as
      you yourself said. I begged her to join her life to mine, and I put the
      plea on the highest possible grounds. All that I have repeated to you, and
      much more, I said to her&mdash;how great was my need of her, how lofty her
      character seemed to me, how all my life I should revere her, and gain
      strength and inspiration from being with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&mdash;m,&rdquo; said Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;?&rdquo; he began, regarding his companion wonderingly&mdash;&ldquo;was
      that not enough? Remember the kind of woman she is&mdash;proud of her
      independence, occupied with large thoughts, not to be appealed to by any
      but the highest motives&mdash;a creature who disdains the sentimental
      romances of inferior women&mdash;do you mean that there should have been
      something more? I do love her&mdash;and should I have told her so in so
      many words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s our foible,&rdquo; she made answer. On the face that she
      turned to him, something like the old merry light was shining. &ldquo;You
      goose!&rdquo; she scolded at him, genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes sparkled up as with a light from her own. &ldquo;Oh, I will make some
      excuse, and get away from these people, and find her,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;She will
      be returning, if not here, then to the inn, down below the church, don&rsquo;t
      you think? There would be nothing out of the way in my riding down, would
      there? Or if I sent a man down with a letter, appealing to her not to go
      away&mdash;telling her why? There is no earthly reason why she should not
      stop here at the Castle. Her sister is here&mdash;why, of course, she
      belongs quite to the family party. How dull of me not to have thought of
      that! Of course, Cora can go and fetch her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I would leave Cora out of it,&rdquo; Kathleen advised him. &ldquo;There is
      nothing that you cannot do better yourself. Come here! Do you see that
      patch of reddish stain on the hill there, above the poplars where the iron
      has colored the rock? Well, look to the right, on the ledge just a bit
      higher up&mdash;there is Miss Bailey. I have been watching her for some
      minutes. She has been round the hill; the path she is on will lead her to
      the Mere Copse&mdash;and to the heath beyond the orchards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes had found the moving figure, microscopic yet unmistakable in the
      sunshine against the verdant face of the hill&mdash;and they dwelt upon it
      for a meditative moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to Kathleen, and took her hand, and almost wrung it in his
      own. &ldquo;Do let us go in!&rdquo; he urged her, with exultant eagerness.

      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>hristian,
      professing to himself momentarily that the chance to get away from his
      guests was at hand, discovered that his escape, all the same, was no easy
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen had disappeared somewhere, and without her he seemed curiously
      helpless. He did not as yet know the house well enough to be sure about
      its exits. The result of one furtive attempt at flight was to find himself
      in the midst of a group of county people, who fell back courteously at his
      approach and, as if by design, let him become involved in a quite
      meaningless conversation with a purple-faced, bull-necked old gentleman
      whose name he could not remember. This person talked at tremendous length,
      producing his words in gurgling spasms; his voice was so husky and his
      manner so disconcerting&mdash;not to mention the peculiarities of the
      local dialect in which he spoke&mdash;that Christian could make literally
      nothing of his remarks. He maintained a vapid listener&rsquo;s-smile, the while
      his eyes roamed despondently about the room, and what he could see of the
      next apartment, in search of some relief. If he could hit upon Dicky
      Westland&mdash;or even Edward or Augustine!
    </p>
    <p>
      It became apparent to him, at last, that his interlocutor was discoursing
      on the subject of dogs. Of course&mdash;it would be about the Caermere
      hounds. On the grave faces of those about him, who stood near enough to
      hear the sounds of this mysterious monologue, he read signs that they
      considered themselves a party to it. It was on their behalf as well as his
      own that the old gentleman was haranguing him&mdash;and he swiftly
      perceived the necessity of paying better attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hounds&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he said, after a little. &ldquo;I have been making
      inquiries about them. I am advised that they cannot be kept up properly
      for less than four thousand five hundred a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to Lord Porlock&rsquo;s death, we had something like twenty-four hundred
      pounds from the Castle, and we made a whip-round among ourselves,&rdquo; the
      other replied, &ldquo;for the rest. With corn what it is, and rents what they
      are, we&rsquo;re all so poor now that it&rsquo;ll be harder than ever to get
      subscriptions, but we&rsquo;ll try to do our share if the Castle&rsquo;ll meet us
      half-way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian felt that he liked being referred to as &ldquo;the Castle.&rdquo; Moreover,
      an idea suddenly took shape in his mind. &ldquo;My uncle, Lord Porlock, was the
      Master,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And before him my grandfather, I believe. But what has
      been done since Lord Porlock&rsquo;s death&mdash;about a new Master, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out of the complicated response made to this question he gathered vaguely
      that nothing had been done&mdash;that nothing could have been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cousin, Captain Torr, is a hunting man, I think.&rdquo; He threw out the
      question with some diffidence, and was vastly relieved to see the faces
      brighten about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None better, by God!&rdquo; affirmed the old gentleman, with vehemence, and
      there followed a glowing and spluttering eulogium of Edward&rsquo;s
      sportsmanlike qualities and achievements, in the middle of which Christian
      recalled that the speaker was Sir George Dence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the Mastership to continue in the family, Sir George,&rdquo; he replied,
      suavely proud of the decision he had leaped to. &ldquo;I think I shall suggest
      to you that Captain Edward take the hounds, and that, for a time at least,
      you allow the Castle to be at the entire expense. At all events, you have
      my annual subscription of five thousand pounds to begin upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a dignified half-bow in the silence which ensued, and boldly moved
      away. The murmur of amazed admiration which rose behind him was music in
      his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visions of possible escape rose for the moment before him. He walked with
      an air of resolution through the next room, trying to remember whither the
      corridor outside led&mdash;but at the doorway he stopped face to face with
      Lord Lingfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said his cousin, amiably, &ldquo;I did not know if I should see you again.
      I thought perhaps that you had gone to lie down. Funerals take it out of
      one so, don&rsquo;t they? My father is quite seedy since lunch, and poor Lady
      Cressage has the most wretched headache! I think myself she&rsquo;d do better
      not to travel while it lasts, but she&rsquo;s anxious to get away, and so we&rsquo;re
      all off by the evening train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t dream of your hurrying off like this,&rdquo; exclaimed Christian,
      sincerely enough. &ldquo;But if you are set upon it&mdash;come, let&rsquo;s find your
      father. It will seem as if I had neglected him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in his room,&rdquo; explained Lord Lingfield, as they moved away
      together, &ldquo;getting into some heavier clothes. The evenings are chilly here
      in the hills, and we&rsquo;re to start almost immediately, and take the long
      drive round through the forest. Lady Cressage has talked so much of it,
      and we&rsquo;ve never seen it, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is all too bad!&rdquo; urged Christian. &ldquo;You rush away before I have
      had time to have a word with any of you. There is no urgent reason for
      such haste, is there now, really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Cressage seems anxious to go,&rdquo; answered the other, with a kind of
      significance in his solemn voice. &ldquo;And of course&mdash;since she came with
      us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian stole a quick glance at his kinsman, and as swiftly looked away.
      &ldquo;If she prefers it&mdash;of course,&rdquo; he commented with brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think she is very strong?&rdquo; asked Lord Lingfield. &ldquo;I have a kind of
      fear, sometimes, that her health is not altogether robust. She seemed very
      pale to-day.&rdquo; There was a note of obvious solicitude in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a headache,&rdquo; Christian reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that would account for it, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; The young man was visibly
      relieved by this reflection. &ldquo;They may say what they like,&rdquo; he went on,
      &ldquo;she is the most beautiful woman in London to-day, just as she was when
      she was married. Let me see&mdash;I am not sure that I ever knew her
      precise age. Do you happen to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is four-and-twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more! I should have said six, or at least five. Hm-m!
      Four-and-twenty!&rdquo; The reiteration, for some reason, seemed to afford him
      pleasure. &ldquo;I am nearly thirty myself,&rdquo; he added meditatively, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
      practically sure of being in the next Government. Shall you go in much for
      politics, do you think? It wouldn&rsquo;t be of any great use to you, except the
      Garter, perhaps, and it&rsquo;s so fearfully slow waiting for that. My father
      had the promise of it as long ago as Lord John Russell&rsquo;s time, and it
      hasn&rsquo;t come off yet. But then that Home Rule business was so unfortunate&mdash;it
      sent us all over to the Tory side, where there were already more people
      waiting for things than there were things to go round. If I were you, I
      would keep very quiet for a year or two&mdash;not committing myself openly
      to either side. I can&rsquo;t help thinking there will be a break-up. It&rsquo;s a
      fearful bore to have only twenty or thirty people on one side and five
      hundred on the other. They won&rsquo;t stand it much longer. It doesn&rsquo;t make a
      fair distribution of things. Of course, I&rsquo;m a Unionist, but if I were in
      your shoes, I&rsquo;d think it over very carefully. The Liberals haven&rsquo;t got a
      single Duke&mdash;and mind you, though people don&rsquo;t seem to notice it, it
      is a fact that a party practically never succeeds itself. The Liberals are
      bound to come in, sooner or later&mdash;and then, if you were their only
      Duke, why, you&rsquo;d get your Garter shot at you out of a gun&mdash;so to
      speak. Of course, I mustn&rsquo;t be mentioned as saying this&mdash;but you
      think it over! And it needn&rsquo;t matter in the least&mdash;our being in
      different parties.. We can help each other quite as well&mdash;indeed,
      sometimes I&rsquo;m tempted to think even better. Of course, I dare say there
      won&rsquo;t be much that I can do for you&mdash;for the next two or three years,
      at least&mdash;except in the way of advice, and tips, and that sort of
      thing&mdash;but there may be a number of matters that you can help me in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian nodded wearily&mdash;with a nervous thought upon the time being
      wasted. &ldquo;I am not likely to forget your kindness&mdash;or our family
      ties,&rdquo; he said, consciously evasive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never saw Cressage, of course; awful beast!&rdquo; remarked the other, with
      an irrelevancy which still struck the listener as having a certain method
      in it. &ldquo;It makes a man furious to think what she must have suffered with
      him. And a mere child, too, when she was married. Only four-and-twenty
      now! These early marriages are a great mistake. Of course, when a man gets
      to be nearly thirty, and there is a family and property and so on to be
      handed along, why, then marriage becomes a duty. That has always been my
      view. And I try invariably to do my duty, as I see it. I think a man ought
      to, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian sighed, and restrained an impulse to look at his watch. They had
      sauntered forward into the central hallway; through the open door could be
      seen a carriage and pair drawn up before the steps. A rustle on the stairs
      behind him caught his ear, and turning, Christian beheld Lady Cressage
      descending toward him, with Lord Chobham looming, stately and severe, in
      the shadows above her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian moved impulsively to her. &ldquo;It was the greatest surprise to me&mdash;and
      disappointment, too&mdash;to hear that you were going like this,&rdquo; he
      declared, with outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled feebly, and regarded him with a pensive consideration. Her
      heavy mourning of an earlier hour had been exchanged for a black garb less
      ostentatiously funereal, yet including the conventional widow&rsquo;s-fall,
      which he had not seen her wear before. The thought that here at Caermere,
      last autumn, she had not even worn a widow&rsquo;s-cap, rose in his mind. It
      carried with it a sense of remissness, of contumacy as against the great
      family which had endowed her with one of its names. But at least now she
      exhibited a consciousness that her husband was less than a year dead. And
      her pallid face was very beautiful in its frame of black&mdash;a
      delicately strong face, meditative, reserved, holding sadness in a proud
      restraint. &ldquo;I am not very well,&rdquo; she said to him, in tones to reach his
      ear alone. &ldquo;The crowd here depressed me. I could not bring myself to
      appear at luncheon. It seems better that I should go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is such a fatiguing journey&mdash;for one who does not feel wholly
      up to it!&rdquo; he urged upon her. &ldquo;All these strangers will be going&mdash;I
      think some of them have gone already. I don&rsquo;t know what their rule is here
      about stopping after luncheon&mdash;but surely they must clear out very
      soon. Then we shall be quite by ourselves&mdash;so that if that is your
      only reason for going&mdash;why, I can&rsquo;t admit that it is a reason at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and strove to cover with a halting smile his sudden perception
      that they were not talking with candor to each other. There were things in
      her mind, things in his mind, which bore no relation to the words they
      uttered. She was looking at him musingly&mdash;and he felt that he could
      read in her glance, or perhaps gather from what there was not in her
      glance, that she would not go if he begged her with sufficient earnestness
      to remain. Nay, the conviction flashed vividly uppermost in his thoughts
      that even a tolerable simulation of this earnestness would be enough. It
      was as if a game were being played, in which he was not quite the master
      of his moves. In this mere instant of time, while they had stood facing
      each other, he had been able to reproduce the whole panorama of his
      contact with this beautiful woman. From that first memorable day when she
      had come into his wondering, distraught vision of the new life before him,
      to that other day but a week ago when he had stood trembling with
      passionate emotions in her presence, his mental pictures of her rose
      connectedly about him. They exerted a pressure upon his will. They left
      him no free agency in the matter. By all the chivalric, tenderly
      compassionate memories they evoked, he must bid her to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry that you feel you must go,&rdquo; was what he heard himself say
      instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she answered simply, and gave him her gloved hand with an
      impassive face. &ldquo;Lord Chobham and Lord Lingfield are good enough to see me
      back to London again. We are driving round through the forest. Our people
      are to join us at the station with the luggage. Goodbye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He accompanied the party out to the carriage door, despite some formal
      doubts about its being the proper thing to do. Both father and son made
      remarks to him, to which he seemed to himself to be making suitable
      answers, but what they were about he never knew. The tragedy of Edith&rsquo;s
      final departure from Caermere&mdash;she who had been the hostess here when
      he came; she who was to have worn the coronet on her lovely brow as the
      mistress of it all&mdash;seized upon his mind and harrowed it. A vehement
      self-reproach that his thoughts should have done her even momentary
      injustice stung him, as he beheld her seated in the carriage. She smiled
      at him&mdash;that wistful, subdued smile of the headache&mdash;and then,
      as the horses moved, his eyes were resting upon another smile instead&mdash;the
      beaming of fatuous content upon the countenance of Lord Lingfield, who sat
      facing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian, regarding this second cousin of his as the carriage receded
      from view, suddenly breathed a long sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once remembering many things, he wheeled with the impulse to run up
      the steps. Upon reflection, he ascended them sedately instead, and gave
      orders in the hall that Mr. Westland should be sent to him forthwith. Two
      or more groups of departing guests came upon him, while he stood
      irresolutely here, and he bade them farewell with formal gravity. The two
      parsons whom he had seen at the church were among them&mdash;attired now
      in black garments with curiously ugly little round, flat hats&mdash;and he
      noted with interest that their smirking deference now displeased him less
      than it had done in the morning. He perceived that his lungs were becoming
      accustomed to the atmosphere of adulation, and smiled tolerantly at
      himself. How long would it be, he wondered with idle amusement, before it
      would stifle him to breathe any other air?
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustine had sauntered out from some unknown quarter into the hall, and
      Christian beckoned to him. A shapeless kind of suspicion, born of a
      resemblance now for the first time suggesting itself, had risen in his
      brain. He took the young man by the arm, and strolled aside with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I wrong,&rdquo; he asked carelessly, &ldquo;or did I see you at the supper at the
      Hanover Theater? Let us see&mdash;it would be a week ago to-night? I
      thought so. Why I asked&mdash;I was curious to know whom you were with. It
      was a young man; you were standing together between some scenery as I
      passed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Augustine, with visible reassurance. &ldquo;That was Tom Bailey&mdash;Cora&rsquo;s
      brother, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort is he?&rdquo; Christian pursued, secretly astonished at the inspired
      accuracy of his intuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;replied the other, hesitatingly&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s rather hard to
      say. He got sent down from Cambridge for something or other, and his
      governor got the needle over it, and put him on an allowance of a pound a
      week, or something like that, and so what could he do? It&rsquo;s jolly hard on
      a young fellow round town to have less money than anybody else. He&rsquo;s bound
      to get talked about, if he only owes half-a-crown to some outsider or
      other, and that makes other fellows turn shirty. But I think he always
      pays when he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like him, then, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;I like Tom well enough,&rdquo; answered Augustine, dubiously
      pondering the significance of the interrogatory. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be all right if&mdash;if
      he had a proper chance.&rdquo; With a sigh, he ventured to add: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like the
      rest of us&mdash;that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At sight of Dicky Westland&rsquo;s approach. Christian dropped his inquiries
      abruptly. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, with enigmatic brevity, and turned to his
      secretary with a meaning gesture. &ldquo;I want to get away from here&mdash;out
      of the Castle,&rdquo; he murmured to the newcomer, &ldquo;without a minute&rsquo;s delay. I
      have a&mdash;kind of appointment, and I am already late. If you will get
      our hats, we will walk out together, as if we were discussing some private
      matter, and then no one will interrupt us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This confidence was only partially justified by events. The two made their
      way unmolested into the open air, and across some long stretches of lawn
      to the beginning of the series of gardens. It was within Christian&rsquo;s
      memory that one reached the orchards and the opening upon the heath by
      traversing these gardens. But in the second of them, where remarkable
      masses of tulips in gorgeous effulgence of bloom occupied the very beds in
      which he believed the dahlias must have been last year, there was some one
      on the well-remembered path in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little child of two or three years, still walking insecurely at least,
      was being led along the edge of the flower-border by a woman in black
      whose back was turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infant had caught the notion of bending over the hyacinths, one by
      one, laboriously to smell their perfume, and the woman indulgently lent
      herself to the pastime, halting and supporting the little one by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian wondered vaguely what child this could be, before observation
      told him that the person they were approaching was a lady. He took Dicky&rsquo;s
      arm then, and quickened their step. &ldquo;We will be very much engaged as we
      pass,&rdquo; he admonished him. After a few paces, however, the futility of this
      device made itself apparent. The lady, glancing indifferently over her
      shoulder at the sound, of their tread, turned on the instant with a little
      cry of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Cora who came toward them, now radiant of face and with an extended
      hand. She dragged the surprised child heedlessly along at her side with
      the other arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Duke!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I did so long to burst in upon you, wherever you
      were to be found, and thank you when I heard. It was Sir George Dence who
      told us. And Eddy, he&rsquo;s quite off his head with joy! He wanted to look you
      up, too, but I told him to put off thanking you till to-morrow; between
      ourselves, I don&rsquo;t fancy he&rsquo;ll be seen quite to the best advantage later
      on to-day. But I know you&rsquo;ll think none the worse of him for that; and
      there&rsquo;s a good bit to be done, he says, in the way of pulling the Hunt
      together again to work like one man. He&rsquo;s begun already promoting the
      right sort of feeling. He&rsquo;s got Sir George and old General Fawcett and
      about a dozen more of &rsquo;em in the billiard-room, and I told him
      everything would be all right so long as they didn&rsquo;t sing. On account of
      the funeral, you know. And&mdash;why, you&rsquo;ve never seen my oldest
      unmarried daughter! Look up and say, &lsquo;How-de-do?&rsquo; Chrissy. Why, she&rsquo;s your
      namesake! Yes, her baptismal name is Christiana or Christina&mdash;which
      is it? We always call her Chrissy. And you haven&rsquo;t told me what an
      effective family group I make. You never would have believed that I could
      be so domestic, now, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had gathered the child up into her arms, and under the influence of
      her jocund mood Christian smiled cheerfully. &ldquo;You are very wonderful as a
      mother,&rdquo; he assured her, and extended a tentative finger toward Chrissy,
      who, huddled in awkward and twisted discomfort under her mother&rsquo;s elbow,
      regarded him with unconcealed repulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seems an extremely healthy child,&rdquo; he remarked, and the words were
      not so perfunctory as they sounded. The robust, red cheeked heartiness of
      Chrissy raised musing reflections in his mind. If this infant, with its
      stout mottled arms and legs, had been a boy, it would be at this moment
      his heir. No one could ask for a finer child&mdash;and she was very
      closely akin to him. And Cora was her mother&mdash;and Cora&rsquo;s sister!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but where <i>are</i> we going to live?&rdquo; she broke in upon his
      meditations. &ldquo;I said to Eddy that I&rsquo;d lay odds you were thinking of
      David&rsquo;s Court for us. You know the kennels used to be there before
      Porlock&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that we can arrange,&rdquo; said Christian, shaking off his reverie, and
      lifting his hat. &ldquo;Rest easy in your mind about everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded with an expansive geniality which freely included Dicky as
      well, and then walked away. It slowly occurred to Christian that she had
      said nothing about her sister&rsquo;s presence in the neighborhood, although it
      was impossible to suppose her ignorant, of it. Upon consideration, he
      decided that her reticence was delicate. He felt that he liked Cora, and
      then uneasily speculated upon the seeming probability that his liking for
      her was in excess of her sister&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Westland,&rdquo; he said, with a new thought in his busy brain, &ldquo;you know about
      geography&mdash;about where the different British colonies are on the map,
      and what they are distinguished for. I want to know of a good place, a
      very long way off, where two young men with a moderate capital might do
      well, or-at least have the chance to do well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellows like that generally go to South Africa, nowadays,&rdquo; replied Dicky,
      &ldquo;though I believe it&rsquo;s gone off a bit. It&rsquo;s not as far away as Australia,
      but it&rsquo;s livelier, apparently. They don&rsquo;t seem to come back as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have a prejudice against that Johannesburg. It is not a good
      atmosphere, and it is too easy to get into trouble there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are great reports about British Columbia just now. They&rsquo;ve found
      wonderful new gold-fields, and they&rsquo;re a fearful distance from anywhere.
      It takes you months to get to them, so I&rsquo;m told. But it depends so much on
      what the fellows themselves are like. If I may ask, do I know them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Augustine Torr that I have in mind, and a young friend of his&mdash;Bailey
      his name is. By the way, a brother of the lady we just left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know <i>of</i> him,&rdquo; commented Dicky sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it has occurred to me that these young men, for whom there seems no
      specially suitable foothold in England, might accomplish something in the
      colonies. That is the way Greater Britain, as they call it, has been made&mdash;by
      young men who might have done nothing at all worth doing at home. Life is
      really very difficult and complicated in this crowded island, unless one
      has exactly the temperament to succeed. But in the colonies it is
      different. Men who are of no use here may become valuable there. I have
      heard that there are many instances of this. And these young men, it seems
      to me that very possibly, if they found themselves on new ground, they
      might do as others have done and get on. We do not quite know what to do
      with them here, but we send them out, and they make the Empire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather rough on the Empire, though, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Dicky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian frowned and drew himself up a little. &ldquo;One is my cousin,&rdquo; he
      said coldly, &ldquo;and the other is the brother of&mdash;is the brother of my
      cousin&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of silence, and then the secretary, as upon a sudden
      resolution, stopped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good my going on,&rdquo; he said, nervously, but
      with decision. &ldquo;I daresay you don&rsquo;t mean it, but all the same it&rsquo;s too
      much for me. If you don&rsquo;t mind, I think I&rsquo;ll turn it up and catch the
      evening-train. I don&rsquo;t mind going to the station in the brake with the
      servants and the luggage. It certainly won&rsquo;t take anybody by surprise.&rdquo;
       Christian regarded him with open-eyed astonishment. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
      you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; he said, in obvious candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dicky restlessly threw out his hands. &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t stand this Dukeness of
      yours,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;You put it on too thick. I know Gus Torr, and I know
      as much as I want to of Tom Bailey, and I know they&rsquo;re no good, and you
      know it, too&mdash;although I don&rsquo;t say they mayn&rsquo;t get on in the
      colonies. God knows what won&rsquo;t get on there! But when I make some
      perfectly civil and natural remark on the subject, you flame up at me, and
      blow yourself out like a pouter pigeon, and say they&rsquo;re&mdash;haw-haw!&mdash;relations
      of yours. Well, that be damned, you know! It may do once in a way with
      outsiders, but it isn&rsquo;t good enough to live with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dicky!&rdquo; said Christian, in a voice of awed appeal. His brown face
      distorted itself in lines of painful bewilderment as he gazed at his
      companion. &ldquo;Have I done that? Is it as bad as that?&rdquo; He gasped the
      questions out in a frightened way and tears sprang into his eyes. &ldquo;Then it
      is not you who should catch the evening train, but me. I am not fit to be
      here!&rdquo; He finished with a groan of bitter dejection and bowed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Westland, as much scared as surprised at the violent result of his
      protest, moved impetuously to his friend and put a hand on his shoulder.
      &ldquo;No-no! No-no,&rdquo; he said, in a soothing voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right! I said you
      didn&rsquo;t mean it, you know. Truly, old man, I <i>knew</i> you didn&rsquo;t mean
      it! Upon my word, it&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian lifted his head, and tried to choke down his agitation. &ldquo;But you
      go away from me!&rdquo; he said in despairing tones. &ldquo;It is the same as ever!
      Nothing is changed for me! I do not make friends&mdash;much less keep
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I <i>am</i> your friend! You <i>are</i> keeping me!&rdquo; Dicky insisted,
      raising his voice. An odd impulse to laugh aloud struggled confusedly with
      the concern the other&rsquo;s visible suffering gave him. &ldquo;I take it all back.
      I&rsquo;m stopping with you, right enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian accepted the assurance in a dazed way, and after he had silently
      shaken the other&rsquo;s hand, began walking on again, studying the ground with
      a troubled frown. &ldquo;I am a weak and dull fool!&rdquo; he growled at last, in rage
      at himself. &ldquo;I have not sense enough to behave properly! It is a mistake
      that I should he put over anybody else! I make myself ridiculous, like any
      <i>parvenu</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;that&rsquo;s all rot,&rdquo; the other felt it judicious to urge. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      perfectly all right, only&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; Christian filled in the gap of hesitation with an angry
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually a calmer view of himself pervaded his mind. &ldquo;It is more
      difficult than you think, Dicky,&rdquo; he affirmed, after a pause. &ldquo;It is not
      easy at all&mdash;at first&mdash;to&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;to keep
      feeling your feet under you on the solid ground. The temptation to soar,
      to think you are lifted up, is upon you every minute. It catches you
      unawares. Ah! I see one must watch that without ceasing. Oh, I am glad&mdash;more
      glad than I can tell you&mdash;that you stopped me. Ah! that was a true
      friend&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dicky chuckled softly: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much nicer, if you can take it that way,&rdquo; he
      admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am ever anything but nice to <i>yoo</i>,&rdquo; Christian began, gravely,
      and then stopped as if he had bitten his tongue. &ldquo;Oh, there is patronage
      again!&rdquo; he cried with vexation&mdash;and then let himself be persuaded to
      join in the frank laughter that the other set up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we shall hit it off all right,&rdquo; Dicky assured him as a final word on
      the subject. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s merely a question of time. You&rsquo;ve got to get accustomed
      to your new job, and I to mine: that&rsquo;s all there is of it. We shall learn
      the whole bag of tricks in a week or so, and be happy ever afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The joking refrain struck some welcome chord in Christian&rsquo;s thoughts. He
      looked up, and noted that they were very near the door leading out from
      the fruit-garden to the heath beyond the wall. Halting, he smiled into his
      companion&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one will follow me now,&rdquo; he said with sparkling eyes. &ldquo;I will let you
      turn back here, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>hristian realized
      blankly, all at once, as&rsquo; he stood and gazed out over the moor, that he
      did not know his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spring had laid upon this great rolling common a beauty of its own.
      Everywhere, on thorns and furze and briars, the touch of the new life had
      hung emeralds to bedeck and hide the dun waste of winter. The ashen-gray
      carpets of old mosses were veined with the vivid green of young growths;
      out from the dry brown litter of lifeless ferns and bracken were rising
      the malachite croziers of fresh fronds. The brilliant yellow of broom and
      gorse blooms caught the eye in all directions, blazing above the vernal
      outburst of another year&rsquo;s vegetation, and the hum of the bees in the
      sunlight, and the delicately mingled odors in the May air were a delight
      to the senses. But under this exuberance of re-awakened nature, welcome
      though it might be, somehow the landmarks of last autumn seemed to have
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path which had led along the wall, for example, was now nowhere
      discernible. Or had there really been a path at any time?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear enough, at all events, that his course for some distance lay
      beside this massive line of ancient masonry, even if no track was marked
      for him. At some farther point it would be necessary to turn off at a
      right angle toward the Mere Copse&mdash;and here he could recall
      distinctly that there had been a path. But then he came upon several
      paths, or vaguely defined grassy depressions which might be paths, and the
      divergent ways of these were a trouble to him. At last, he decided to
      strike out more boldly into the heath, independently of paths, and try to
      get a general view of the landscape. He made his way through creepers and
      prickly little bushes toward an elevation in the distance, realizing more
      and more in his encumbered progress that his quest was like that of one
      who should search the limitless sea for a small boat. There seemed no
      boundaries whatever to this vast tract of waste land.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he began at length the ascent of the mound toward which his course had
      been directed, he scanned the moor near and far, but no human figure was
      visible. No signs could he discover of any beaten track across it; of the
      several patches of woodland beyond, in the distance to the left, he could
      not even be sure which was the Mere Copse. Below, on the edge of the
      sky-line at the right, he could see the tops of the towers and chimneys of
      Caermere. Wheeling round from this point, then, he endeavored to identify
      that portion of the hill, on the opposite side of the river-chasm, which
      Kathleen had pointed out to him from the terrace. But, viewed from here,
      there were so many hills! The hopelessness of his errand became more
      apparent with each glance round. Despondently, he sauntered up the few
      remaining yards to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood upon the ridge of a grass-grown wall of stones and earth, which
      in a somewhat irregular circle enclosed perhaps a quarter-acre of land.
      This wall on its best preserved side, where he found himself, was some
      dozen feet in height. Across the ring it seemed lower, and at three or
      four points was broken down altogether. He realized that he was surveying
      a very ancient structure&mdash;no doubt, prehistoric. Would it have been a
      fortress or a temple, or the primitive mausoleum of some chieftain-ruler
      in these wilds? One of the openings seemed to suggest by its symmetry an
      entrance to the enclosure. It was all very curious, and he promised
      himself that very soon he would examine it in detail. Some vague
      promptings of a nascent archaeological spirit impelled him now, upon
      second thoughts, to walk round on the crest of the wall to the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he stopped, stared sharply downward with arrested breath, and
      then, while his face wreathed itself with amused smiles, tip-toed along a
      few paces farther. Halting here, his eyes dancing with suppressed gaiety,
      he regarded at his leisure the object of his expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the sunny outer side of the sloping embankment, only a few feet
      below, was seated Frances Bailey. Her face was turned from him, and she
      was apparently engrossed in the study of a linen-backed sectional map
      spread on her knees. A small red book lay in the grass at her side, and he
      was so close that he could decipher the legend &ldquo;Shropshire and Cheshire&rdquo;
       on its cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a minute&rsquo;s rapturous reflection he turned and noiselessly retraced
      his steps, till he could descend from the wall without being seen. There
      was a kind of miniature dry moat surrounding it at this point, and this he
      lightly vaulted. Then, straightening himself, he strolled forward with as
      fine an assumption of unsuspecting innocence as he could contrive. It
      occurred to him to whistle some negligent tune very softly as he came,
      but, oddly enough, his lips seemed recalcitrant&mdash;they made no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the obtrusion of his shadow upon the map she was examining she looked
      swiftly up. For a moment, with the afternoon sun in her eyes, she seemed
      not to recognize him. There followed another pause, infinitesimal in
      duration, yet crowded with significance, in which she appeared clearly at
      a loss what to say or do, now that she realized the fact of his presence.
      Then she smiled at him with a kind of superficial brightness and tossed
      the map aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am fortunate indeed to find you,&rdquo; he said, as he came up, and they
      shook hands formally. A few moments before, when he had looked down upon
      her from the mound, he had been buoyantly conscious of his control of the
      situation; but now that he stood before her it was she who looked down
      upon him from her vantage-ground on the side of the bank, and somehow this
      seemed to make a great deal of difference. The sound of his voice in his
      own ears was unexpectedly solemn and constrained. He felt his deportment
      to be unpleasantly awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ignored the implication that he had been looking for her. &ldquo;I suppose
      this must be the place that is marked &lsquo;tumulus&rsquo; on the map here,&rdquo; she
      observed, with what seemed to be a deliberately casual tone. &ldquo;But I should
      think it is more like a rath, such as one reads about in Ireland&mdash;a
      fortified place to defend one&rsquo;s herds and people in. As I understand it, a
      tumulus was for purposes of burial, and this seems to be a fort rather
      than a tomb. What is your idea about it?&rdquo; She rose to her feet as she put
      the question, and turned to regard the earthworks above and about her with
      a concentrated interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m more ignorant about them than anybody
      else,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;I have never been here before. I suppose all one can
      really say is that the people who did these things knew what they were
      for, but that since they had no alphabet they could not leave a record to
      explain them to us, and so we are free to make each his own theory to suit
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very indolent view to take,&rdquo; she told him over her shoulder.
      &ldquo;Scientists and archaeologists are not contented with that sort of reply.
      They examine and compare and draw deductions, and get at the meaning of
      these ancient remains. They do not sit down and fold their hands and say,
      &lsquo;Unfortunately those people had no alphabet.&rsquo; Why don&rsquo;t you dig this thing
      up and find out about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled to himself doubtfully, &ldquo;I have only been in possession of it for
      about three hours,&rdquo; he reminded her. Then an inspiration came to, him.
      &ldquo;Would <i>you</i> like to dig it up?&rdquo; he asked, with an effect of
      eagerness shining through the banter of his tone. &ldquo;I mean, to superintend
      the excavations. You shall have forty men out here with picks and shovels
      to-morrow if you say the word.&rdquo; Instead of answering, she stooped to get
      her book and map, and then moved with a preoccupied air to the top of the
      bank. After an instant&rsquo;s hesitation he scrambled up to join her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that would have been the entrance there,&rdquo; she observed,
      pointing across the circle. &ldquo;And in the center, you see, where the grass
      is so thin, there are evidently big stones there. That <i>does</i> suggest
      interment after all, doesn&rsquo;t it? Yet the Silurians are said to have buried
      only in dolmens. It is very curious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not find that I care much about Silurians this afternoon,&rdquo; he
      ventured to say. There was a gentle hint of reproach in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re one yourself! That is the principal point about the Torrs;
      that is what makes them interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what good does it do me to be a Silurian and interesting,&rdquo; he
      protested with a whimsical gesture, &ldquo;if I&mdash;if I do not get what I
      want most of all in the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that you have got more things already than most people on
      this planet.&rdquo; She went on reflectively: &ldquo;I had no idea at all what it
      meant till I saw these hills and the valleys below them, and the forests
      and the villages and the castle, and the people coming out from heaven
      knows what holes in the rocks&mdash;all with your collar round their
      necks. I should think it would either send you mad with the sense of power
      or frighten you to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really very humble about it, I think,&rdquo; he assured her simply. &ldquo;And
      there is not so much power as you seem to imagine. It is all a great
      organized machine, like some big business. The differences are that it
      works very clumsily and badly as it is at present managed, and that it
      hardly pays any dividend at all. The average large wholesale grocer&rsquo;s or
      wine merchant&rsquo;s estate would pay a bigger succession duty than my
      grandfather&rsquo;s. He died actually a poor man.&rdquo; The intelligence did not
      visibly impress her. &ldquo;But it was not because he helped others,&rdquo; she
      remarked. &ldquo;Those about him grew poorer also. It is a hateful system!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something you do not know,&rdquo; he began with gravity. &ldquo;I said that
      my grandfather died a poor man. But since his death a tremendous thing has
      happened. A great gift has been made to me. The enormous debts which
      encumbered his estates have been wiped out of existence. It is Lord Julius
      and Emanuel who have done this&mdash;done it for me! I do not know the
      figures yet&mdash;to-morrow Mr. Soman is to explain them to me&mdash;but
      the fact is I am a very rich man indeed. I do not owe anybody a penny.
      Whatever seems to be mine, <i>is</i> mine. There are between seventy-five
      and eighty thousand acres. By comparison with other estates, it seems to
      me that there will be a yearly income of more than fifty thousand pounds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a long breath and looked him in the face. &ldquo;I am very sorry for
      you,&rdquo; she said soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no; I resist you there,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I quote your own words to
      you: &lsquo;It is an indolent view to take.&rsquo; There is a prodigious
      responsibility! Yes! But all the more reason why I should be brave. Would
      you have me lose my nerve, and say the task is too great for me? I thought
      you did not like people who solved difficulties by turning tail and
      running away. Well, to confess oneself afraid&mdash;that is the same
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled thoughtfully, perhaps at the quaint recurrence to foreign
      gestures and an uncertain, hurried use of book-English which her company
      seemed always to provoke in him. &ldquo;I meant only that it was a terrible
      burden you had had fastened upon your shoulders,&rdquo; she made answer softly.
      &ldquo;I did not suggest that you were afraid of it. And yet I should think you
      would be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he responded, with a kind of diffident conviction, &ldquo;I think
      that if a man is honest and ambitious for good things, and has some
      brains, he can grow to be equal to any task that will be laid upon him.
      And if he labors at it with sincerity and does absolutely the best that
      there is in him to do, then I do not think that his work will be wasted. A
      man is only a man after all. He did not make this world, and he cannot do
      with it what he likes. It is a bigger thing, when you come to think of it,
      than he is. At the end there is only a little hole in it for him to be
      buried in and forgotten, as these people who raised this wall that we
      stand on are forgotten. They thought in their day that the whole world
      depended upon them; when there was thunder and lightning, they said it was
      on their account, because their gods in the sky were angry with them. But
      to us it is evident that they were not so important as they supposed they
      were. We look at the work of their hands here, and we regard it with
      curiosity, as we might an ant&rsquo;s nest. We do not know whether they made it
      as a tomb for their chief or as a shelter for their cows. And if they had
      left records to explain that, and it does not matter how much else, it
      would be the same. We learn only one thing from all the numberless
      millions who have gone before us&mdash;that man is less important than he
      thinks he is. I have a high position thrust upon me. <i>Eh bien!</i> I am
      not going to command the sun to stand still. I am not going to believe
      that I ought to revolutionize human society before I die. There will be
      many men after me. If one or two of them says of me that I worked hard to
      do well, and that I left things a trifle better than I found them, then
      what more can I desire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded in musing abstraction, but answered nothing. Her gaze was
      fastened resolutely upon the opposite bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am truly so fortunate not to have missed you!&rdquo; he repeated after a
      small interval of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you say that?&rdquo; she asked almost with petulance. &ldquo;You make too
      much of me! I do not belong in this gallery at all. I am very angry with
      myself for being here. I ought not to have allowed Mrs. Emanuel to
      persuade me against my own judgment. It did not enter into my head that I
      should be seen by anybody. I was on my vacation&mdash;I take it early,
      because some of the girls like to get away at Whitsuntide&mdash;and at
      Bath I saw in a paper some reference to the state with which your
      grandfather would be buried, and the whim seized me to see the funeral. I
      came on my bicycle most of the way, till the hills got too bad. I thought
      no one would be the wiser for my coming and going. And one thing&mdash;you
      must not ask me to come into the castle again. I am going to the inn to
      get my machine, and go down to Craven Arms or Clun for the night. I have
      looked both roads out on my map. Is Clun interesting, do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the remotest idea. In fact, there is only one idea of any sort
      in my mind just now. It is that you are not to be allowed to go away. Have
      you seen the dungeons in which we fasten up people whose presence is
      particularly desired, and who will not listen to reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The jesting tone of his words was belied by the glance in his eyes. She
      frowned a little. &ldquo;No, there is no reason in it at all. What have I to do
      with these people? They are not my kind. It is the merest accident that
      you and I happen to be acquainted. If you did not know me now, nothing is
      more certain than that we should never meet in the world. And our seeming
      to each other like friends on those other occasions&mdash;that had nothing
      to do with the present. The circumstances are entirely different. There is
      nothing in common between us now, or hardly anything at all. You ought to
      understand that. And I look to you to realize how matters are altered, and
      not to insist upon placing me in a very undignified and unpleasant
      position.&rdquo; She had spoken with increasing rapidity of utterance, and with
      rising agitation. &ldquo;Not that your insisting would make any difference!&rdquo; she
      added now, almost defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her in silence. The face half turned from him, with its broad
      brow, its shapely and competent profile, the commanding light in its gray
      eyes, the firm lips drawn into tightened curves of proud resistance to any
      weakness of quivering&mdash;it was the face that had made so profound an
      impression upon him at the outset of that wonderful journey from Rouen.
      The memory became on the instant inexpressibly touching to him. She was
      almost as she had been then&mdash;it might well be the same sober gray
      frock, the same hat, save that the ribbon now was black instead of fawn.
      She would have no varied wardrobe, this girl who earned her own bread, and
      gave her mind to the large realities of life. But this very simplicity of
      setting, how notably it emphasized the precious quality of what it framed!
      He recalled that in his first rapt study of this face it had seemed to him
      like the face of the young Piedmontese bishop who had once come to his
      school&mdash;pure, wise, sweet, tender, strong. And now, beholding it
      afresh, it was beyond all these things the face which woke music in his
      heart&mdash;the face of the woman he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      With gentle slowness he answered her: &ldquo;The position I seek to place you in
      does not seem to me undignified. I should like to hope that you would not
      find it unpleasant. You know what I mean&mdash;I offered it to you in
      advance, before it was yet mine to give. I beg you again to accept it, now
      when it <i>is</i> mine to give. If you will turn, you can see Caermere
      from where you stand. It has had in all its days no mistress like you.
      Will you take it from my hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She confronted him with a clear, steady gaze of disapproval. &ldquo;All this is
      very stupid!&rdquo; she said, peremptorily. &ldquo;Last week&mdash;it had its pretty
      and graceful side then perhaps, but it is not nice at all now. It does not
      flatter me; it does not please me in any way to-day. I told you then, I
      had my own independence, my own personal pride and dignity, which are
      dearer to me than anything else. If I had them then, I have them very much
      more now. What kind of idea of me is this that you have&mdash;that I am to
      change my mind because now you can talk of fifty thousand a year? I like
      you less than I did when you had nothing at all! For then we seemed to
      understand each other better. You would not have rattled your money-box at
      me then! You had finer sensibilities&mdash;I liked you more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned her gaze with a perplexed smile. &ldquo;But I am asking you to be my
      wife,&rdquo; he pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sniffed with a suggestion of contempt at the word. &ldquo;Wife!&rdquo; she told
      him stormily. &ldquo;You do not seem to know what the word &lsquo;wife&rsquo; means! You are
      not thinking of a &lsquo;wife&rsquo; at all. It is a woman to play Duchess to your
      Duke that you have in mind, and you feel merely that she ought to be
      presentable and intelligent, and personally not distasteful to you; we&rsquo;ll
      even say that you prefer a woman towards whom you have felt a sort of
      comrade&rsquo;s impulse. But that has nothing to do with a &lsquo;wife.&rsquo; And even on
      your own ground how foolish you are! In heaven&rsquo;s name, why hit on <i>me</i>
      of all women? There are ten thousand who would do it all vastly better,
      and who, moreover, would leap at the chance. You have only to look about
      you. England is full of beauties in training for just such a place. They
      know the ways of your set&mdash;the small talk, the little jokes, the
      amusements and social duties and distinctions, and all that. Go and find
      what you want among them. What have I to do with such people? They&rsquo;re not
      in my class at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christian sighed, and then sought her glance again with a timid, whimsical
      smile. &ldquo;Ah, how you badger me always!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I have still
      something more to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me beg that it be left unsaid!&rdquo; She folded up the map, and began
      moving along the ridge as she spoke. &ldquo;It is all as distressful to me as
      can be. You cannot understand&mdash;or will not understand&mdash;and it
      puts me in an utterly hateful position. I do not like to be saying
      unpleasant things to you. I had only the nicest feelings towards you when
      we last parted; and this noon, when I saw you in the church, you made a
      picture in my mind that I had quite&mdash;quite a tenderness for. But now
      you force me into disagreeable feelings and words, which I don&rsquo;t like any
      more than you do. I seem to be never myself when I am with you. I have
      actually never seen you but three times, and you disturb me more&mdash;you
      make me hate myself more&mdash;than everything else in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exigencies of the path along the summit of the mound forced Christian
      to walk behind her. In the voice which carried these words backward to him
      the quavering stress of profound emotion was more to him than the words
      themselves. He put out his hand and laid it lightly upon her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because you feel in your heart of hearts that I love you,&rdquo; he said
      in a low, tremulous voice. &ldquo;Can you not see? It is that that has made all
      our meetings disturbed, full of misunderstandings as well as pleasure. You
      wrong me, dear&mdash;or no, you could not do that, but it is that you do
      not comprehend. I have loved you from that first day. Oh, I have loved you
      always, since I can remember&mdash;long years before I saw you. There is
      not any memory in my life, it seems, but of you&mdash;for all the sweet
      things were a foretaste of you, and all the bitter are forgotten because
      of you. And shall there not be an end now to our hurting each other? For
      where you go I follow you, and I must always be longing for you&mdash;and
      I do not believe that in your heart you hold yourself away from me, but
      only in your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had drawn her sleeve from his touch, and irresolutely quickened her
      steps. She perforce paused now at a broken gap in the bank, and with books
      and gathered skirts in one hand, lifted the other in instinctively
      balancing preparation for a descent. He took this hand, and she made no
      demur to his leading her down the steep slope to the level outer ground.
      He retained the hand reverently, gently in his own as they walked in
      silence across the heath. It seemed ever as if she would take it from him,
      and that he consciously exerted a magic through his touch which just
      sufficed to hold it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a bowed head, and cheek at once flushed and white, she began to
      speak. &ldquo;You are very young,&rdquo; she said, lingering over the words with
      almost dejection in her tone. &ldquo;You know so little of what life is like!
      You have such a place in the affairs of men to fill, and you come to it
      with such innocent boyish good faith&mdash;and men are so little like what
      you think they are. And as you learn the lesson&mdash;the hardening,
      disillusionizing lesson of the world&mdash;and the soft, youthful places
      in your nature toughen, and you are a man holding your own with other men,
      and lording it over them where you can, then you will hate the things
      which hamper you, and you will curse encumbrances that you took on you in
      your ignorance. And you are all wrong about me! It is because you do not
      know other women that you think well of me. I am a very ordinary girl,
      indeed. There are thousands like me, and better than me, with more courage
      and finer characters, and you do not know them, that is all. And there are
      the young women of your own little world, who are born and reared to be
      the wives of men in your place, and you will see them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen them,&rdquo; he interposed softly. &ldquo;But it is not fair!&rdquo; she
      hurried on breathlessly. &ldquo;It is the duty of a friend to hold a man back
      when he is bent on a folly. And we pledged ourselves to be true friends,
      and I implore you&mdash;or no, I insist! I will not have it. It is too
      cruelly unfair to you&mdash;and&mdash;I am going now&mdash;no, not that
      way; in the other direction. We will say good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would not relinquish the hand she strove to drag away. All the calmness
      of confident mastery was in his hold upon this hand, and in the gravely
      sweet cadence of his voice. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall love no one in
      my life, or in another life, but you. I will not live without you. I will
      not willingly spend a day in all my years away from you. You are truly my
      other half&mdash;the companion, the friend, the love, the wife, without
      whom nothing exists for me. I am not young as you say I am, and I shall
      never be old&mdash;for in this love there is no youth or age for either of
      us. Try to look backward now! Can you see a time when we did not love each
      other? And forward! Is it thinkable that we can be parted?&rdquo; Slowly she
      lifted her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; she bade him in a voice he seemed never to have heard
      before.

(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
